INTRODUCTION 
 
1.     These explanatory notes relate to the Corporation Tax Bill as introduced in the 
House of Commons on 4 December 2008. They have been prepared by the Tax Law 
Rewrite project at HMRC to assist readers of the Bill and to help inform debate on it. 
They do not form part of the Bill and have not been endorsed by Parliament. 
2.     The notes need to be read in conjunction with the Bill. They are not, and are 
not meant to be, a comprehensive description of its contents. So if a clause or part of a 
clause does not seem to require explanation or comment, none is given. 
 
3.      The commentary on each clause indicates the main origin or origins of the 
clause. A full statement of the origins of each clause is contained in the Bill&#8217;s Table of 
Origins. 
 
4.      At the end of the commentary there is supporting material in two annexes. 
 
     &#8226; Annex 1 contains details of the minor changes in the law made by the Bill. 
 
     &#8226; Annex 2 contains lists of: 
 
       &#8226; the Extra-Statutory Concessions to which the Bill gives effect; 
 
       &#8226; the minor changes made by the Bill which involve giving statutory effect to 
          principles derived from case law; and 
 
       &#8226; provisions not included in the Bill on the grounds of redundancy. 
 
Summary 
5.     The main purpose of the Corporation Tax Bill is to rewrite the charge to 
corporation tax and the primary corporation tax legislation used by companies in 
computing their income. 
 
6.      The Bill does not generally change the meaning of the law when rewriting it. 
The minor changes which it does make are within the remit of the Tax Law Rewrite 
project and the Parliamentary process for the Bill. In the main, such minor changes 
are intended to clarify existing provisions, make them consistent or bring the law into 
line with well established practice. 
 
Background 
The Tax Law Rewrite project 
7.      In December 1995 the Inland Revenue presented a report to Parliament on the 
scope for simplifying the United Kingdom tax system (The Path to Tax 
Simplification). The main recommendation was that United Kingdom direct tax 
legislation should be rewritten in clearer, simpler language. 
8.      This recommendation was warmly welcomed, both in Parliament and in the 
tax community. In his November 1996 Budget speech the then Chancellor of the 
Exchequer (the Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke QC MP) announced that the Inland Revenue 
would propose detailed arrangements for a major project to rewrite direct tax 
legislation in plainer language. 
 
9.      The project team has been carrying out this work. The aim is that the rewritten 
legislation should use simpler language and structure than previous tax legislation. 
The members of the project are drawn from different backgrounds. They include 
longstanding HMRC employees, former private sector tax professionals and 
parliamentary counsel including (as head of the drafting team) a senior member of the 
Parliamentary Counsel Office. 
 
Steering Committee 
10.    The work of the project is overseen by a Steering Committee, chaired by the 
Rt Hon the Lord Newton of Braintree OBE DL. The membership of the Steering 
Committee as at 31 October 2008 was: 
 
       The Rt Hon the Lord Newton of Braintree OBE DL (Chairman) 
       Dr John Avery Jones CBE 
       Adam Broke 
       Baron Christopher of Leckhampton CBE 
       Nicholas Dee 
       Dave Hartnett CB 
       The Rt Hon Michael Jack MP 
       Eric Joyce MP 
       District Judge Rachel Karp 
       Professor John Tiley CBE 
       John Whiting CBE 
 
Consultative Committee 
11.    The work is also reviewed by a Consultative Committee, representing the 
accountancy and legal professions and the interests of taxpayers. The membership of 
the Consultative Committee as at 31 October 2008 was:

Consultation 
12.     The work produced by the project has been subject to public consultation. This 
has allowed all interested parties an opportunity to comment on draft clauses. 
 
13.     This consultation took the form of a series of papers which published clauses 
in draft. There were 20 of these, published between July 2006 and November 2008 
and a draft Bill was published for consultation in February 2008. All these documents 
are available on the Tax Law Rewrite website. 
 
14.     The project also held detailed informal discussions and workshops with 
leading private sector tax professionals and HMRC specialists to consider the drafting 
of the more complex areas of rewritten tax legislation, for example, loan relationships 
and derivative contracts. 
 
15.    Those who responded to one or more of the papers, or to the draft Bill, 
include:

This Bill 
The end of the Schedules 
16.    ITTOIA completed the abolition of Schedules for charging income for income 
tax. This Bill repeals the Schedules so far as they remain for corporation tax and 
therefore marks the end of the Schedules. 
 
Features of the Bill 
17.   The Bill: 
 
      &#8226; contains the basic corporation tax provisions including the charge to tax, 
        accounting periods and provisions relating to residence; 
 
      &#8226; contains provisions relating to trading and property income and income from 
        other sources; 
 
      &#8226; contains special provisions for companies affecting the calculation of income, 
        such as those for loan relationships, derivative contracts and intangible fixed 
        assets; 
 
      &#8226; contains provisions governing particular types of expenditure, for example, 
        expenditure on research and development and films; and 
 
      &#8226; will take the place of many provisions within ICTA, FA 1996, FA 2001 and 
        FA 2002 as the main Act for the areas of corporation tax covered by this Bill. 
 
18.      The Bill has 1330 clauses and four Schedules.

</Clause></Part><Part Number="2" SerialNumber="5">Part 2: Charge to corporation tax: basic provisions 
<Chapter Number="1" SerialNumber="6">Chapter 1: The charge to corporation tax 
Overview 
29.     The process of separating income tax and corporation tax began with ITTOIA 
and continued with ITA, which substantially completed the rewrite of income tax 
legislation for income tax purposes. Following that there were two parallel sets of 
income tax principles. Those in rewrite style apply only for income tax purposes and, 
for example, no longer include Schedules such as Schedule D and its Cases. 
 
30.    Prior to this Bill corporation tax has been dependent on the continuing 
existence of the income tax rules in unrewritten style so that, for example, those 
Schedules and Cases continue to be applied for the purposes of corporation tax. 
 
31.     This Bill continues and finalises the separation process so that the relevant 
principles apply separately for corporation tax. The adoption of this approach means 
that section 9 of ICTA (computation of income: application of income tax principles) 
is repealed by this Bill (apart from section 9(5) which theoretically could have a 
continuing effect). Some of the provisions of section 9 of ICTA are rewritten in clause 
969 and there is a transitional provision in Schedule 2. 
 
32.     This Chapter deals with the charge to corporation tax on profits. The approach 
retains the principle of a single charge, currently under section 6 of ICTA. The charge 
under clause 2 is on amounts of income and on chargeable gains that together form 
the &#8220;profits pot&#8221;. 
 
33.    This contrasts with the multiple charges to income tax in the Income Tax Acts, 
primarily ITTOIA, and reflects the different history of the two taxes. 
 
34.     The way the charge on profits operates is explained in the commentary on 
clause 2. This clause rewrites both section 6(1) and (4) of ICTA and section 9(1) and 
(4) of that Act. In the light of the separation of corporation tax from income tax it is 
necessary to find a different way of expressing the relationship between the general 
charge to corporation tax on income and the provisions that deal with its application. 
 
35.    There are also other charges to corporation tax. These are charges to an 
amount of corporation tax and they do not feature in the &#8220;profits pot&#8221;. There is an 
example of this kind of charge in this Bill &#8211; in clause 75{j032704}(2) (retraining 
courses: recovery of tax). 
 
36.      These are provisions of an administrative nature mainly recovering excessive 
relief. In some of the charges of this kind there are references to the assessment being 
made under Schedule D Case VI. The Case VI label will disappear along with 
Schedule D and the other Cases with the repeal of section 18 of ICTA. The references 
are removed by consequential amendments in Schedule 1. An example is the 
amendment to paragraph 27(4) of Schedule 16 to FA 2002. 
 
<Clause Number="2" SerialNumber="7">Clause 2: Charge to corporation tax 
37.     This clause provides the charge to corporation tax on profits. It is based on 
section 6(1) and (4) and section 9(1) and (4) of ICTA. 
 
38.     Subsection (1) states that corporation tax on profits is charged for a financial 
year for which an Act provides. It is based on the two overlapping propositions in 
section 6(1) of ICTA. 
 
39.     Under subsection (2) &#8220;profits&#8221; in Part 2 means &#8220;income and chargeable gains, 
except in so far as the context otherwise requires&#8221;. This interpretation derives from 
section 6(4) of ICTA. The Bill amends section 6(4) of ICTA in Schedule 1. 
 
40.    Chargeable gains are defined in section 1(1) of TCGA. In subsection (3) &#8220; the 
charge to corporation tax on income&#8221; is introduced as a label. The expression is 
defined for corporation tax purposes as a result of an amendment to section 834(1) of 
ICTA made by Schedule 1 to the Bill. 
 
41.   Subsection (4) provides that the charge to corporation tax on income in effect 
depends on there being another provision of the Corporation Tax Acts that applies it. 
 
42.     This subsection is based on section 9(1) and (4) of ICTA. Section 9(1) in 
effect controls the meaning of &#8220;income&#8221; in section 6 of ICTA. As noted in the 
overview the Bill will complete the split between income tax and corporation tax and 
the formulation in section 9(1) of ICTA is no longer apposite since its wording is 
adapted to the circumstances of applying one body of tax law (income tax principles) 
for the purposes of another tax (corporation tax). 
 
43.    The effect of section 9 of ICTA is that the scope of the charge to income tax 
determines what is income for corporation tax purposes (except as otherwise provided 
by the Tax Acts). Income tax, although primarily a charge to tax on things which 
would be regarded as income in its ordinary sense, is not exclusively a charge on such 
things. Section 9(4) provides that anything that is within the charge to income tax is 
within the charge to corporation tax on income &#8220;whether expressed to be income or 
not and whether an actual amount or not&#8221;. 
 
44.     So the effect of section 9 of ICTA is that (subject to the provisions of the 
Corporation Tax Acts) the charge to corporation tax on income is driven by the 
particular heads of the charge to income tax. 
 
45.    The purpose of this clause is to achieve an equivalent effect, so that the charge 
to corporation tax on income is driven by the particular heads of the charge to 
corporation tax on income. In this way the clause substitutes the provisions of the 
Corporation Tax Acts for the income tax provisions. For example clause 35 applies 
the charge to corporation tax on income to the profits of a trade. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="3" SerialNumber="8">Clause 3: Exclusion of charge to income tax 
46.     This clause ensures that income of a company within the charge to corporation 
tax is not chargeable to income tax as well as corporation tax. It is based on 
section 6(2) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="4" SerialNumber="9">Clause 4: Exclusion of charge to capital gains tax 
47.    This clause ensures that chargeable gains of a company within the charge to 
corporation tax are not chargeable to capital gains tax as well as corporation tax. It is 
based on section 6(3) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="5" SerialNumber="10">Clause 5: Territorial scope of charge 
48.    This clause sets out the territorial scope for the charge to corporation tax. It is 
based on section 8(1) and section 11(1) and (2) of ICTA. 
 
49.     Subsection (1) deals with the position of companies resident in the United 
Kingdom. It restates section 8(1) of ICTA which, although expressed in general terms, 
only has effect in relation to UK resident companies (because of the exception under 
section 11 for non-UK resident companies). 
 
50.   Chapter 3 of this Part sets out the statutory rules for company residence. 
Chapter 4 explains what are chargeable profits in the case of non-UK resident 
companies. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="6" SerialNumber="11">Clause 6: Profits accruing in fiduciary or representative capacity 
51.     This clause deals with profits accruing directly to the company where it is 
acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, for example as a nominee. It is based 
on section 8(2) of ICTA. 
 
52.    In this case the charge under clause 2 only applies where the company has a 
beneficial interest in the profits. 
53.     When a company goes into liquidation it ceases to be the beneficial owner of 
its assets. The exception in subsection (2) means that in this case the company&#8217;s 
profits remain within the charge to corporation tax. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="7" SerialNumber="12">Clause 7: Profits accruing under trusts 
54.     This clause sets out the treatment of profits that do not accrue to the company 
directly but in which the company has a beneficial interest under a trust. It is based on 
section 8(2) of ICTA. 
 
55.     The words &#8220;in any case in which it would be so chargeable if the profits 
accrued to it directly&#8221; are not reproduced because the treatment for which the clause 
provides makes them unnecessary. Profits which are treated as accruing to a company 
directly are chargeable to corporation tax in the same circumstances that they would 
have been had they in fact accrued directly to the company. 
 
56.    There is no reference to profits arising under a partnership in contrast to 
section 8(2) of ICTA. Provisions for the charge to corporation tax on the profits of 
corporate partners are set out elsewhere in the Bill and in particular in Part 17. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="8" SerialNumber="13">Clause 8: How tax is charged and assessed 
57.     This clause sets out how corporation tax is charged and assessed. It is based on 
section 8(3) and section 12(1) of ICTA. 
 
58.      The reference to deductions in section 8(3) and section 12(1) of ICTA and the 
words in brackets in section 12(1) &#8220;(whether or not received in or transmitted to the 
United Kingdom)&#8221; have not been rewritten since they do not add anything substantive 
to these provisions. There are rules elsewhere about what deductions can be made and 
this clause together with clause 5 make it clear that the charge is on profits wherever 
arising. 
 
59.     Section 70(1) is not rewritten in the Bill but is reflected in subsection (3) of 
this clause which contains the general rule about the basis of assessment. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="2" SerialNumber="14">Chapter 2: Accounting periods 
Overview 
60.     This Chapter gives the definition of accounting period. It is based on 
section 12 of ICTA. 
 
61.     The accounting period is a basic building block of corporation tax because 
corporation tax is charged by reference to accounting periods. For nearly all 
established UK resident companies the accounting period coincides with the 12 month 
period for which it makes up its accounts. Most of the Chapter is taken up with rules 
explaining what happens outside the usual case. 
 
62.    The Chapter does not rewrite section 12(8) of ICTA. Section 12(8) is an 
administrative provision that deals with the validity of assessments. The Chapter is 
concerned with when accounting periods begin and end, and not with the 
circumstances in which an officer of Revenue and Customs may make an assessment 
or determination. 
 
<Clause Number="9" SerialNumber="15">Clause 9: Beginning of accounting period 
63.     This clause identifies when an accounting period begins. It is based on 
section 12 and section 342A of ICTA. 
 
64.    Subsection (1)(a) deals with the case in which a company comes within the 
charge to corporation tax. Subsection (1)(a) states an important general rule. This Bill 
does not reproduce the two examples given in section 12(2)(a) of ICTA of 
circumstances in which this general rule would apply (becoming UK resident, 
acquiring a source of income). The examples add nothing useful and might obscure 
the general rule. 
 
65.    Subsection (1)(b) deals with the usual case of a company that is already within 
the charge to corporation tax so that a new accounting period begins when the 
previous accounting period ends. 
 
66.     Subsection (4) disapplies this clause in the case of a company being wound up. 
Clause 12, which makes special provision about companies being wound up, applies 
instead. 
 
67.     Subsection (6) is a general signpost that, in certain circumstances, the rules in 
this clause are modified by rules in other provisions of the Corporation Tax Acts that 
deal with particular cases. The implications for accounting periods will be clear when 
considering the cases in question (for example, paragraph 3 of Schedule 10 to 
FA 2006 (sale of lessor companies) and paragraph 52 of Schedule 22 to FA 2000 
(tonnage tax)). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="10" SerialNumber="16">Clause 10: End of accounting period 
68.   This clause identifies the end of an accounting period. It is based on section 12 
of ICTA. 
 
69.    The starting point for the clause to apply is that the company has an existing 
accounting period. The occurrence of any one of the listed events brings that 
accounting period to an end. In many cases clause 9(1)(b) then applies to start a new 
accounting period. 
 
70.     The opening words of subsection (1) provide that an accounting period ends 
&#8220;on the first occurrence of any of&#8221; the events listed in paragraphs (a) to (j). These 
words fall to be read in relation to each accounting period which is commenced. The 
effect of these words is not that the first event on that list to occur settles how all 
subsequent accounting periods of that company are to end. Rather, the effect is that 
each accounting period may be ended by the occurrence of a different event, 
depending on what happens in that particular accounting period. 
71.     The rules applying to companies in administration have been integrated into 
the general rules. The case is different from where a company is being wound up. In 
that case (see clause 12) there is a self-contained set of rules about when a company&#8217;s 
accounting periods end. In the case of a company in administration, the general rules 
about when an accounting period of a company end continue to apply, but there are 
two additional circumstances in which an accounting period ends. These are the 
circumstances mentioned in subsection (1)(i) and (j). 
 
72.     The legislation rewritten by subsections (1)(i) and (j), (2), (3) and (4) only 
applies to companies that enter administration on or after 15 September 2003. This 
limitation is preserved in Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="11" SerialNumber="17">Clause 11: Companies with more than one accounting date 
73.     This clause allows a company carrying on more than one trade to nominate the 
accounting date which marks the end of the accounting period. It is based on 
section 12 of ICTA. 
 
74.    The clause is most likely to apply to a non-UK resident company carrying on 
more than one trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment. If a 
UK resident company carries on more than one trade it prepares a single set of 
accounts to cover all the company&#8217;s activities. A non-UK resident company may not 
be subject to these regulatory requirements. Without this clause an accounting period 
would end at each separate accounting date. 
 
75.    The company is allowed to choose which accounting date is used for the 
purposes of the test in clause 10(1)(b). The company&#8217;s choice is subject to review by 
HMRC. In the source legislation this power is exercised by the Commissioners for 
HMRC. In practice it is exercised by an officer. Subsection (3) reflects that. See 
Change 1 in Annex 1. 
 
76.     The source legislation does not provide for the situation where a company has 
one or more businesses in addition to its trades, or several businesses but no trade. 
The effect is that the company&#8217;s choice and the officer of Revenue and Customs&#8217; 
discretion is limited to selection of an accounting date relating to one of the 
company&#8217;s trades. In other words, neither the company nor the officer can choose as 
the accounting period end date an accounting date of one of the company&#8217;s businesses 
which is not a trade. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="12" SerialNumber="18">Clause 12: Companies being wound up 
77.   This clause identifies the beginning and end of an accounting period if a 
company is being wound up. It is based on section 12 of ICTA. 
 
78.     Although the rules applying to companies in administration have been 
integrated into the general rules (see clause 10(1)(i) and (j)), the separate exposition of 
the rules applying to companies being wound up have been preserved. This is because 
the scheme of section 12(7) of ICTA is to provide for a self-contained set of rules 
about when an accounting period ends. It follows that the accounting period of a 
company being wound up does not end on the occurrence of any of the events listed in 
clause 10(1)(b) to (j). Accordingly, it is not appropriate to add the termination events 
listed in clause 12 to the list of termination events in clause 10(1). 
 
79.    Subsection (5) is new. It makes provision for when a new accounting period of 
a company being wound up begins. Section 12(7) of ICTA provides for an accounting 
period to begin on the commencement of winding up, but does not provide for the 
commencement of any subsequent accounting period. The rule in section 12(2)(b) of 
ICTA, now clause 9(1)(b), continues to apply for that purpose. It is preferable to make 
separate provision for the commencement of a new accounting period after the end 
of 12 months, rather than rely on clause 9(1)(b) for this purpose. 
 
80.     The reason for this is that the rule in clause 9(1)(b) is that a new accounting 
period only begins at the end of 12 months if the company is still within the charge to 
corporation tax. However, section 12(7) of ICTA does not make the company&#8217;s 
remaining within the charge to corporation tax a condition of a new accounting period 
starting on the company beginning to be wound up. Also, that provision states that &#8220;an 
accounting period shall not end otherwise than by the expiration of 12 months from its 
beginning&#8221;. Given that, section 12(2)(b) of ICTA must necessarily be modified in its 
application to companies being wound up. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="3" SerialNumber="19">Chapter 3: Company residence 
Overview 
81.     This Chapter gives the statutory rules for company residence outside double 
taxation conventions. 
 
82.     The rules on company residence are both statutory and non-statutory. The 
oldest of the company residence rules (&#8220;central management and control&#8221;) is based on 
common law. 
 
83.     The central management and control test is generally considered to be best 
expressed in De Beers Consolidated Mines v Howe (1905), 5 TC 198 HC. &#8220;A 
company resides, for the purposes of Income Tax, where its real business is carried on 
&#8230; I regard that as the true rule; and the real business is carried on where the central 
management and control actually abides&#8221;. This has been endorsed by subsequent 
decisions and was described by Lord Radcliffe in Bullock v Unit Construction 
Company (1959), 38 TC 712 HL as being &#8220;as precise and unequivocal as a positive 
statutory injunction&#8221;. 
 
84.    Residence may also be determined by the tie-breaker in a double taxation 
convention. When a company is resident in the territory of both parties a tie-breaker 
generally awards residence to the country where the effective management of the 
company is situated. 
85.     The two main statutory rules are found in section 66 of FA 1988 and 
section 249 of FA 1994. These two tests are rewritten in this Chapter. 
 
86.     Under section 66 of FA 1988 a company incorporated in the United Kingdom 
is, with some exceptions, regarded as resident here for all tax purposes. This overrides 
the rule in common law given above, although the common law test continues for 
companies outside section 66, that is to say companies which are not incorporated in 
the United Kingdom. 
 
87.     Section 249 of FA 1994 treats a company resident in the United Kingdom 
under the common law test or section 66 of FA 1998 as being non-UK resident if the 
tie-breaker in the double taxation treaty between the United Kingdom and that other 
territory would make the company resident outside the United Kingdom. 
 
88.     Both these statutory rules apply for the purposes of the Taxes Acts as defined 
in section 118 of TMA (see section 66(1) and 66A(2) of FA 1988 and section 249(1) 
of FA 1994). This Bill rewrites the rules for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts 
only. Because the Corporation Tax Acts are defined more narrowly (Schedule 1 to the 
Interpretation Act 1978) than the Taxes Acts, Schedule 1 to this Bill inserts new 
sections into TMA, TCGA and ITA to apply the rules given in this Chapter to those 
Acts. 
 
<Clause Number="13" SerialNumber="20">Clause 13: Overview of Chapter 
89.   This clause sets out which residence rules are dealt with in this Chapter. It is 
new. 
 
90.    Although this Chapter does not legislate the common law test on residence 
(see above), subsection (3) makes clear that clause 15 applies where a company has 
been resident in the United Kingdom under that test. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="14" SerialNumber="21">Clause 14: Companies incorporated in the United Kingdom 
91.    This clause provides that a company incorporated in the United Kingdom is 
resident here for corporation tax purposes and, under clause 5, is within the charge to 
corporation tax on all its income and chargeable gains. It is based on section 66(1) of 
FA 1988. 
 
92.   Subsection (2) makes it clear that a company which is resident in the United 
Kingdom under subsection (1) is not resident in any other territory. 
 
93.     Although section 66 of FA 1988 and section 249 of FA 1994 refer to a 
company being &#8220;regarded as&#8221; resident it is not considered necessary to adopt that or 
similar wording. A company is simply resident somewhere. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="15" SerialNumber="22">Clause 15: Continuation of residence established under common law 
94.     This clause gives rules on residence for companies which are not incorporated 
in the United Kingdom. Companies which were UK resident immediately before they 
ceased business or came under the control of a foreign liquidator continue to be 
treated as UK resident. The clause is based on section 66(2) of FA 1988. 
 
95.     This clause clarifies that the provision applies only to companies which are not 
incorporated in the United Kingdom. That is less clear in the source legislation. Any 
United Kingdom incorporated company which ceases business or is being wound up 
outside the United Kingdom is already UK resident under the rule in the previous 
clause. 
 
96.     The purpose of the rule in this clause is to provide that a company which is 
resident in the United Kingdom through central management and control (see above) 
remains resident here. Such a company could otherwise become non-UK resident if 
central management and control left the United Kingdom. 
 
97.     Section 66(4) of FA 1998 gives effect to Schedule 7 to that Act, the 
commencement and transitional provisions. Paragraphs of that Schedule which are not 
spent are rewritten in Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings) to this Bill. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="16" SerialNumber="23">Clause 16: SEs which transfer registered office to the United Kingdom 
98.    This clause provides that once an SE (&#8220;Societas Europaea&#8221; &#8211; see clause 1319) 
has transferred its registered office to the United Kingdom it becomes and remains 
resident there, notwithstanding its residence elsewhere under overseas law or the 
subsequent transfer of its office abroad. The clause is based on section 66A of FA 
1988. 
 
99.    This clause applies only to SEs which transfer their registered office to the 
United Kingdom since SEs that are formed here are resident in the United Kingdom in 
any event under clause 14. 
 
100. Once the registered office is moved to the United Kingdom the SE is 
effectively treated as if it were incorporated there. It cannot cease to be resident at any 
time simply by transferring its registered office. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="17" SerialNumber="24">Clause 17: SCEs which transfer registered office to the United Kingdom 
101. This clause provides the same rule for SCEs (European Cooperative Societies 
&#8211; see clause 1319) that clause 16 provides for SEs. It is based on section 66A of FA 
1988. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="18" SerialNumber="25">Clause 18: Companies treated as non-UK resident under double taxation 
arrangements 
102. Under this clause a company which is resident in the United Kingdom, but 
treated under a double taxation convention as resident in a territory outside the United 
Kingdom, is resident outside the United Kingdom for corporation tax purposes. The 
clause is based on section 249 of FA 1994. 
 
103.   Section 250 of FA 1994 is spent. It is repealed by this Bill. 

 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="4" SerialNumber="26">Chapter 4: Non-UK resident companies: chargeable profits 
Overview 
104. This Chapter sets out which profits of a non-UK resident company are liable to 
corporation tax. It is based on sections 11 and 11AA of, and Schedule A1 to, ICTA. 
 
105. The Schedules themselves contain rules on territorial scope. 
Section 18(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of ICTA brings within the charge to tax under Schedule D 
annual profits or gains accruing to a UK resident from (a) any kind of property 
whatever wherever situated and (b) from any trade wherever carried on. Section 
18(1)(a)(iii) brings within the same charge to tax annual profits or gains accruing to a 
non-UK resident from any property in the United Kingdom or from any trade or 
profession exercised there. Section 18 of ICTA is not itself a charge but a method of 
computing and marshalling under a Schedule income that is charged to tax under 
section 6 of ICTA. 
 
106. Section 9 and section 18(4A) of ICTA apply section 18(1) (Schedule D) of 
ICTA for corporation tax purposes. But section 11 of ICTA sets out another rule on 
the scope of the corporation tax charge on a non-UK resident company. 
 
107. The scope of Schedule D in section 18 of ICTA is narrower than the charge in 
section 11 of ICTA. Under section 18 non-UK residents are only liable to tax in 
respect of annual profits or gains from property in the United Kingdom or from trades 
exercised there. Under section 11 a non-UK resident company is chargeable to 
corporation tax on all profits wherever arising that are attributable to its permanent 
establishment in the United Kingdom and on income from property or rights held by 
or for the permanent establishment through which it trades. There is no requirement 
that that property should be in the United Kingdom. 
 
108. The seventh edition (1999) of Taxation of Companies and Company 
Reconstructions by Bramwell et al (footnote to page 421) says of section 11(2): 
 
    These words appear to be rather wider than the income tax &#8220;profits or gains arising from any trade 
    exercised within the United Kingdom&#8221;. It is possible that the corporation tax charge on trading profits 
    extends beyond the income tax charge, perhaps, for example, in the area of overseas activities 
    connected with a United Kingdom branch. 
 
109. Section 70(3) of ICTA enables a non-UK resident company to be charged to 
corporation tax under Schedule D Case V. 
 
110. Prior to the removal of Case IV for corporation tax purposes in FA 1996, 
section 70(3) of ICTA extended Schedule D Cases IV and V to non-UK residents. 
(The replacement of &#8220;Case IV&#8221; by &#8220;Case III&#8221; as a consequential amendment in FA 
1996 made little sense since section 18(3A) of ICTA already brought income arising 
outside the United Kingdom into Schedule D Case III for corporation tax purposes.) 
 
111. The FA 1965 Notes on Clauses for the section on which section 70(3) of ICTA 
is based read: 
112. Section 70(3) of ICTA would seem to confirm that non-UK resident 
companies can be charged on income arising outside the United Kingdom and thus 
confirm the wider scope and precedence of section 11 of ICTA over 
section 18(1)(a)(iii) of ICTA (see above). 
 
113. Section 18(1)(a)(iii) of ICTA is therefore redundant for corporation tax 
purposes because it adds nothing to section 8 of ICTA, which deals with the scope of 
corporation tax generally, and section 11 of ICTA. 
 
114. Section 70(3) is not rewritten. The section adds nothing to the basic position of 
a non-UK resident company under clauses 5(3) and (4) and 19. Moreover the 
parenthetical words in section 70(3) (&#8220;but without prejudice to any provision of the 
Tax Acts especially exempting non-residents from tax on any particular description of 
income&#8221;) apply on first principles to income falling within the definition of 
&#8220;chargeable profits&#8221;. 
 
115. A reordering of the clauses on permanent establishments in this Chapter is 
intended to clarify the relationship between the various provisions. First comes the 
charge on the profits attributable to the permanent establishment followed by an 
introductory clause explaining how the clauses are set out and how they apply. 
 
116. This is followed by the clauses on the separate enterprise principle. Those that 
apply this principle specifically to banks are at the end of this group of clauses. The 
special rules on deductions then appear at the end of the Chapter. 
 
117. Much of the terminology employed in sections 11 and 11AA of, and Schedule 
A1 to, ICTA is shared in common with the Model Tax Treaty and Commentary of the 
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Indeed the 
legislation is intended to reflect to a considerable degree the Model Treaty and 
Commentary. This terminology is retained so that the relationship between the two is 
not lost. 
 
<Clause Number="19" SerialNumber="27">Clause 19: Chargeable profits 
118. This clause sets out what profits of the non-UK resident company are charged 
to tax. It is based on sections 11(1) to (2A) and 11AA(1) of ICTA. 
 
119. Subsection (2) provides that income and chargeable gains form part of the 
non-UK resident company&#8217;s chargeable profits only if they are of a type specified in 
subsection (3) and are attributable to the company&#8217;s permanent establishment. This is 
a rather different approach to that in section 11(2A) of ICTA but, read with 
section 11AA(1) of ICTA, it seems that section 11(2A) of ICTA is merely identifying 
the types of income and gains that are capable of being attributed to the permanent 
establishment and not giving the amount of those income and gains. 
 
120. Subsection (3)(c) brings into the chargeable profits of a company chargeable 
gains falling within section 10B of TCGA. The chargeable gains falling within that 
section are those accruing to a company on the disposal of assets situated in the 
United Kingdom. Such gains are relevant in this context if the assets in question are 
connected with the trade carried on by the company through the permanent 
establishment or are for use by or for the purposes of the establishment. 
 
121. &#8220;Permanent establishment&#8221; is defined in section 148 of FA 2003 and appears 
in Schedule 4 (index of defined expressions). 
 
122. Neither the words &#8220;subject to any exceptions provided for by the Corporation 
Tax Acts&#8221; nor the second sentence of section 11(2) of ICTA are rewritten as they are 
considered unnecessary. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="20" SerialNumber="28">Clause 20: Profits attributable to permanent establishment: introduction 
123. This clause describes how the clauses that follow are set out and how they 
apply. It is based on section 11AA(1) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="21" SerialNumber="29">Clause 21: The separate enterprise principle 
124. This clause sets out the basic rule of the separate enterprise principle. It is 
based on section 11AA(2) and (3) of, and paragraph 1(2) of Schedule A1 to, ICTA. 
 
125. The terms &#8220;distinct and separate enterprise&#8221; and &#8220;credit rating&#8221; in this clause 
are unique to section 11AA of ICTA. The former term is taken from Article 7 of the 
Model Treaty and the latter from the commentary on that article. The meaning of the 
former is well understood from its use in double taxation conventions while the latter 
takes its normal commercial meaning, a meaning that is well established through 
credit ratings given by agencies such as Moody&#8217;s or Standard and Poor. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="22" SerialNumber="30">Clause 22: Transactions treated as being on arm&#8217;s length terms 
126. This clause provides the rule for dealing with transactions between the 
permanent establishment and the rest of the non-UK resident company. It is based on 
paragraph 2 of Schedule A1 to ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="23" SerialNumber="31">Clause 23: Provision of goods or services for permanent establishment 
127. This clause sets out the rule for goods and services provided by the non-UK 
resident company to the permanent establishment. It is based on paragraph 6(1) to (3) 
of Schedule A1 to ICTA. 
 
128. Although this clause deals with both a deduction (expense) &#8211; see 
subsection (3) &#8211; and the separate enterprise principle, it is grouped with other clauses 
dealing with the separate enterprise principle as that is the main rule here and to 
separate these elements would be unhelpful. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="24" SerialNumber="32">Clause 24: Application to insurance companies 
129. This clause provides the power for the making of regulations in respect of the 
application of clause 21 to insurance companies. It is based on section 11AA(5) of 
ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="25" SerialNumber="33">Clause 25: Non-UK resident banks: introduction 
130. This clause introduces clauses 26 to 28 which contain particular provisions 
applying the separate enterprise principle to banks. It is based on paragraph 7(1) 
and (2) of Schedule A1 to ICTA. 
 
131. While these provisions are an application of the separate enterprise principle 
with particular relevance to banks, the principles behind them are applicable to 
companies other than banks and subsection (2) clarifies this point. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="26" SerialNumber="34">Clause 26: Transfer of financial assets 
132. This clause applies the separate enterprise principle to loans or financial assets 
transferred between the permanent establishment and any other part of the company. 
It is based on paragraphs 7(1) and 8(1) and (2) of Schedule A1 to ICTA. 
 
133. Each of the clauses applying the separate enterprise principle to banks contains 
the phrase &#8220;in accordance with the separate enterprise principle&#8221; to clarify that the 
provisions given are all within the general principle in clause 21 and not expressing 
new principles. 
 
134. Subsections (3) and (4) retain the term &#8220;valid commercial reasons&#8221; in 
paragraph 8(2) of Schedule A1 to ICTA notwithstanding that the usual phrase adopted 
in rewrite Bills is either &#8220;commercial reason&#8221; or &#8220;genuine commercial reason&#8221;. This is 
because &#8220;valid commercial reason&#8221; is the term used in the Commentary 
(paragraph 15.2) to Article 7(2) of the treaty. 
 
135. Subsection (4) also contains the term &#8220;tax advantage&#8221;. The term is undefined 
(as in the source legislation) although its use elsewhere in the Taxes Acts refers to the 
definition in section 709 of ICTA. The absence of a definition in paragraph 8(2) of 
Schedule A1 is intentional. It was considered that any attempt to define all possible 
and future forms of tax advantage in this context would have added complexity for no 
good purpose. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="27" SerialNumber="35">Clause 27: Loans: attribution of financial assets and profits arising 
136. This clause explains how a financial asset (eg a loan) made by the non-UK 
resident company and the profits arising from it should be attributed (whether to the 
permanent establishment or another part of the company). It is based on paragraphs 
7(1) and 9(1) and (3) to (5) of Schedule A1 to ICTA. An example would be where a 
permanent establishment in the United Kingdom obtains new business and passes that 
business back to the overseas part of the company. Resulting loans, derivatives etc can 
be attributed to the permanent establishment under this clause notwithstanding that 
they have been issued by an overseas office. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="28" SerialNumber="36">Clause 28: Borrowing: permanent establishment acting as agent or intermediary 
137. This clause applies the separate enterprise principle where a permanent 
establishment of a non-UK resident bank acts as an agent or intermediary in 
borrowing funds for another part of the company. It is based on paragraphs 7(1) 
and 10(1) and (2) of Schedule A1 to ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="29" SerialNumber="37">Clause 29: Allowable deductions 
138. This clause brings together some general rules on deductions allowable in 
arriving at the profits of a permanent establishment. It is based on section 11AA(4) of, 
and paragraph 3(1) and (2) of Schedule A1 to, ICTA. 
 
139. &#8220;Executive and general administrative expenses&#8221; in subsection (2) are not 
defined. The term is borrowed from Article 7(3) of the OECD Model Treaty. The 
Commentary on the Model Treaty does not define the term further but &#8220;executive 
expenses&#8221; would seem to cover the expenses of higher management of the permanent 
establishment. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="30" SerialNumber="38">Clause 30: Restriction on deductions: costs 
140. This clause is the first of three clauses which restrict deductions in arriving at 
the attributable profits of a permanent establishment. It provides that no deduction for 
costs should exceed what would be payable under the separate enterprise principle. It 
is based on section 11AA(3) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="31" SerialNumber="39">Clause 31: Restriction on deductions: payments in respect of intangible assets 
141. This clause disallows a deduction for inter-company payments for the use of 
intangibles where the intangible assets are held by the company. The reasoning here is 
that it is difficult to allocate ownership of intangibles to any one part of a company as 
if it were an independent enterprise. The clause is based on paragraph 4(1) to (3) of 
Schedule A1 to ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="32" SerialNumber="40">Clause 32: Restriction on deductions: interest or other financing costs 
142. This clause applies the same principle as the previous clause but to interest 
payments. An exception is, however, made for companies dealing in loans, debts 
commodities and futures. It is based on paragraph 5(1) to (3) of Schedule A1 to ICTA. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="5" SerialNumber="41">Chapter 5: Supplementary 
<Clause Number="33" SerialNumber="42">Clause 33: Trade includes office 
143. This clause provides that trade includes an office in Part 2 of the Bill, subject 
to context. It is based on section 6(4) of ICTA which applies the definition of &#8220;trade&#8221; 
in paragraph (b) of that subsection to various provisions of ICTA, except in so far as 
the context otherwise requires. 
 
144. The reference to &#8220;carrying on a trade&#8221; in paragraph (b) is new. It reflects one 
of the usages of &#8220;trade&#8221; in Part 2. 
145. The interpretation does not refer to employment or vocation. The treatment of 
vocations is discussed in Change 2 in Annex 1. A company does not hold an 
employment but it is not uncommon for a company to hold an office such as that of 
company secretary and the charge to corporation tax on income from an office is set 
out in clause 969. 
 
146. Clause 969 applies the charge to corporation tax on income under clause 2 to 
income from the holding of an office.

       Case I or V); and 
 
    &#8226; post-cessation receipts (charged in the source legislation under Schedule D 
       Case VI). 
 
148.   The structure of the Part is to: 
 
    &#8226; identify the income taxed as profits of a trade (Chapter 2); 
 
    &#8226; calculate the profits of the trade (Chapters 3 to 7); 
 
    &#8226; apply the rules for particular trades (Chapters 8 and 9); 
 
    &#8226; apply other rules affecting the calculation of profits of the trade (Chapters 10 to 
       14); and 
 
    &#8226; identify the other component of trading income &#8211; post-cessation receipts &#8211; 
       (Chapter 15). 
 
149. This Part is not an exhaustive statement of the rules for the calculation of 
trading income. Other regimes may affect that calculation. In particular, Parts 5 to 8 
and 11 to 15 of this Bill contain rules that may affect trade profits. 
 
150. References to &#8220;profits or gains&#8221; in the source legislation which relate only to 
income are rewritten in this Part omitting the reference to &#8220;gains&#8221;. This continues the 
tidying up of such references started in section 46(3) of, and Schedule 7 to, FA 1998. 
 
<Chapter Number="1" SerialNumber="44">Chapter 1: Introduction 
<Clause Number="34" SerialNumber="45">Clause 34: Overview of Part 
151. This clause provides an overview of this Part. It is new. The corresponding 
income tax rule is in section 3 of ITTOIA. 
152. In contrast to section 3 of ITTOIA, this clause makes no reference to 
adjustment income. This is because for corporation tax purposes adjustments on a 
change of basis of accounting are brought into account in computing trading profits 
rather than being treated as a distinct category of income. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="2" SerialNumber="46">Chapter 2: Income taxed as trade profits 
Overview 
153. This Chapter explains what is taxed as profits of a trade. It identifies a number 
of activities and receipts and sets out how they are treated. 
 
<Clause Number="35" SerialNumber="47">Clause 35: Charge to tax on trade profits 
154. This clause applies the corporation tax charge on income to the profits of a 
trade. It is based on section 18 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 5 of ITTOIA. 
 
155. The clause does not rewrite the reference to &#8220;profession or vocation&#8221; in 
Schedule D Case II. See Change 2 in Annex 1. 
 
156. Section 832(1) of ICTA provides that &#8220;trade&#8221; includes &#8220;every trade, 
manufacture, adventure or concern in the nature of trade&#8221;. This brings within the 
meaning of trade an isolated transaction (or a small number of transactions) which, 
while in the nature of trade, is not sufficiently extensive to amount to a trade. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="36" SerialNumber="48">Clause 36: Farming and market gardening 
157. This clause has two functions. First, it treats all farming or market gardening 
carried on in the United Kingdom as a trade. Second, it treats all farming carried on in 
the United Kingdom by a particular person as a single trade. It is based on section 53 
of ICTA. The rules for income tax are rewritten in section 9 of ITTOIA. 
 
158. Subsection (1) deals with the first function. In most cases there will be no 
doubt that farming is a trade on first principles. Like clause 38 of this Bill this clause 
can trace its origins back to the time when there was a charge to income tax under 
Schedule B on the occupation of land. Farming was originally charged under 
Schedule B. The purpose of section 53 of ICTA and its predecessor provisions was to 
take the charge on farming out of Schedule B and into Schedule D. With the abolition 
of Schedule B that function is now spent. 
 
159. But section 53 of ICTA does make clear that even uncommercial farming is 
treated as a trade. This clause preserves that effect. 
 
160. Subsection (2) deals with the second function of the clause. It provides that all 
farming carried on by a company in the United Kingdom is treated as a single trade. It 
makes clear that farming carried on as part of another trade is not included in the 
single trade of farming. 
161. The restriction of subsection (2) to farming in the United Kingdom is derived 
from the definition of &#8220;farming&#8221; in section 832(1) of ICTA. 
 
162. Section 53(2) of ICTA uses the expression &#8220;particular company or 
partnership&#8221; to make clear that the single trade rule applies also to a firm. It follows 
that farming carried on by a company as a member of a firm is separate from any 
farming carried on by that company alone. This rule is dealt with in clause 1270 in 
Part 17 (Partnerships). The corresponding provision for income tax is section 859 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
163. The definition of &#8220;farming&#8221; and &#8220;market gardening&#8221; is given in clause 1317 in 
Part 21 (Other general provisions). The corresponding provision for income tax is 
section 996 of ITA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="37" SerialNumber="49">Clause 37: Commercial occupation of woodlands 
164. This clause provides that the commercial occupation of woodlands is not 
treated as a trade for any corporation tax purpose. It is based on section 53 of ICTA 
and paragraph 3 of Schedule 6 to FA 1988. The corresponding rule for income tax is 
in section 11 of ITTOIA. 
 
165. Subsection (3) makes clear that when this clause is read together with related 
clauses any profits and losses arising from the commercial occupation of woodlands 
are wholly outside the corporation tax code. 
 
166. This clause prevents any charge to tax as trading income and denies any claim 
for relief for a trade loss. Clause 208(b) of this Bill performs a similar function in 
relation to property income. Clause 980 prevents there being any charge to tax under 
Chapter 8 of Part 10 (income not otherwise charged). The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 768 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="38" SerialNumber="50">Clause 38: Commercial occupation of land other than woodlands 
167. This clause deals with the commercial occupation of land for purposes other 
than farming or woodlands. It is based on section 53 of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 10 of ITTOIA. 
 
168. The clause treats the commercial occupation of land in the United Kingdom as 
the carrying on of a trade. It provides certainty of treatment if land is occupied on a 
commercial basis in circumstances that do not amount to the carrying on of a trade on 
first principles. 
 
169. The origins of section 53 of ICTA go back to the time when there was a 
charge to income tax under Schedule B on the occupation of land. The purpose of the 
Schedule B charge was to tax the profit that an occupier of the land could earn from 
the land itself, for example, by farming it. The tax was charged whether or not the 
occupier actually exploited the land. 
170. The Schedule B charge was calculated by reference to the annual value of the 
land. This amount could be considerably less than the amount of profit an occupier 
could in fact derive from the land. For this reason the basis of charge was switched 
from Schedule B to Schedule D Case I if the land was farmed or otherwise managed 
on a commercial basis. 
 
171. The last remnant of Schedule B was repealed by FA 1988. Schedule 6 to FA 
1988 exempted any profits and losses from the occupation of commercial woodlands 
from corporation tax. 
 
172. The provisions of section 53 of ICTA relating to farming are rewritten as 
clause 36 of this Bill. The provisions relating to the occupation of commercial 
woodlands are rewritten as clause 37 of this Bill. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="39" SerialNumber="51">Clause 39: Profits of mines, quarries and other concerns 
173. This clause treats the profits and losses of certain concerns as if they were the 
profits and losses of a trade. It is based on section 55 of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 12 of ITTOIA. 
 
174. The feature that most of these concerns have in common is that they exploit 
land for its natural resources. The clause applies only if the activity carried on by the 
concern does not amount to a trade on first principles. If the activity is a trade on first 
principles the profits and losses will be taxed in accordance with clause 35 of this Bill. 
 
175. The clause does not deem the concern to be carrying on a trade. The company 
will not qualify for roll-over relief under section 152 of TCGA on any chargeable 
gain. That section requires the taxpayer to be carrying on a trade as defined in 
section 158(2) of TCGA. If the concern is operated by a company not resident in the 
United Kingdom that company does not become liable to corporation tax through the 
application of clause 5(2). Clause 5(2) requires a trade to be carried on in the United 
Kingdom. 
 
176. Subsections (1) and (2) provide that the profits and losses of the concern are 
calculated and charged to tax as if the concern were a trade. The source legislation 
was not explicit in this regard. See Part A of Change 3 in Annex 1. This change 
reproduces Change 2 in ITTOIA and so brings the income tax and corporation tax 
codes back into line. 
 
177. Subsection (3) provides that the normal loss rules apply. See Part B of Change 
3 in Annex 1. 
 
178. Subsection (4) lists the concerns to which the clause applies. It updates the 
reference to &#8220;fishings&#8221; to &#8220;rights of fishing&#8221;. 
 
179. Subsection (5) makes clear that clause 38 of this Bill has priority over clause 
39. This is because clause 38 treats the activity as if it were a trade. This contrasts 
with the approach of this clause, which is to treat the profits and losses as trade profits 
and losses. Clause 38 may be more beneficial for the company. For example, the 
activity would qualify as a trade for chargeable gains purposes. See section 158(2) of 
TCGA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="40" SerialNumber="52">Clause 40: Credit unions 
180. This clause ensures that most credit unions are not treated as carrying on a 
trade for tax purposes. It is based on section 487 of ICTA. 
 
181. Credit unions are profit-sharing financial co-operatives, owned and managed 
by their own members, which offer a convenient way of saving and loans to their 
members. 
 
182. The members make regular savings, as little or as much as they wish. These 
savings then form a common pool of money from which loans are made to members. 
When members have been saving for a certain period of time (usually about 12 
weeks) they can apply for a loan from the pool. Interest on the loan is charged at 
about 1% per month on the monthly reducing balance. 
 
183.   There are other rules about credit unions: 
 
    &#8226; in Part 5 (loan relationships); 
 
    &#8226; in clause 133; and 
 
    &#8226; in clause 1218. 
 
184. Subsection (1) is the rule that the usual activities of a credit union are not to be 
treated as a trade. The rule applies only in the calculation of the credit union&#8217;s income. 
So, if the carrying on of a trade is relevant for some other purpose (for instance, the 
taxation of chargeable gains), and the credit union is in fact carrying on a trade, the 
position is not disturbed by this rule. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="41" SerialNumber="53">Clause 41: Effect of company starting or ceasing to be within charge to 
corporation tax 
185. This clause treats a company as starting or ceasing to carry on a trade in 
particular circumstances. It is based on section 337 of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 18 of ITTOIA. 
 
186. Section 337 of ICTA requires the company&#8217;s trade or property business 
income to be calculated as though it had started or ceased to carry on a trade or a 
property business in two cases. Clause 41 deals with trades and clause 289 with 
property businesses. 
 
187. The first trade case is when the company begins or ceases to carry on the trade 
(section 337(1)(a) of ICTA). Then its profits from that trade are calculated as though 
the trade had, at that time, begun or ceased. It is not necessary to rewrite this case. It is 
dealt with automatically in the rewritten rules because they are &#8220;person-based&#8221; and do 
not assume that a particular trade can continue independently of the person actually 
carrying it on. 
 
188. The second case involves movement by the company into or out of the 
corporation tax regime (section 337(1)(b) of ICTA). Non-UK resident companies are 
within the charge to corporation tax only if they are trading, are trading in the United 
Kingdom, and through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom. Then they 
are chargeable to corporation tax on all the profits attributable to that permanent 
establishment. First meeting or ceasing to meet those conditions can result in a change 
of taxing regime from income tax to corporation tax or vice versa. 
 
189. Clause 41 says what happens when a company enters or leaves the corporation 
tax regime in respect of the trade: then its trade profits are calculated as though it had 
started or ceased to carry on the trade. The corresponding income tax rule in section 
18 of ITTOIA is a complementary, mirror-image rule which applies when the 
company enters or leaves the income tax regime in respect of the trade. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="42" SerialNumber="54">Clause 42: Tied premises 
190. This clause treats rent received by a company carrying on a trade, for premises 
let to persons to whom the company supplies goods sold or used on those premises, as 
a receipt of the trade rather than a receipt of a property business. It is based on section 
98 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 19 of ITTOIA. 
 
191. Section 98 of ICTA is expressed in general terms. But it most commonly 
applies to rent received by a brewing company which lets premises to tied tenants. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="43" SerialNumber="55">Clause 43: Caravan sites where trade carried on 
192. This clause allows a company which carries on a trade associated with the 
operation of a caravan site to include in the receipts of that trade income from letting 
pitches or caravans where the letting does not itself constitute a trade. It is based on 
ESC C36. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 20 of ITTOIA. See 
Change 4 in Annex 1. 
 
193.    See clause 1314 and Change 96 in Annex 1 for the definition of &#8220;caravan&#8221;. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="44" SerialNumber="56">Clause 44: Surplus business accommodation 
194. This clause allows income from letting surplus business accommodation to be 
treated as a trade receipt instead of as rent. It is based on the practice known as 
&#8220;Revenue Decision 9&#8221; set out in the HMRC publication Tax Bulletin of 15 February 
1994. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 21 of ITTOIA. See Change 
5 in Annex 1. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="45" SerialNumber="57">Clause 45: Payments for wayleaves 
195. This clause applies if a trader receives rent from a wayleave granted in respect 
of land on which a trade is carried on. It is based on section 120 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 22 of ITTOIA. 
 
196. Rent received in respect of a wayleave is normally taxed as property income 
either by Chapter 2 of Part 4 of this Bill (property businesses) or by clause 277 
(charge to tax on rent receivable for a UK electric-line wayleave). But if the rent is 
received in respect of land on which a trader carries on a trade and the trader receives 
no other rent in respect of the same land the rent, and any associated expenses, can be 
included in the calculation of the trade profits. See Change 6 in Annex 1. This change 
enacts a non-statutory practice, and also makes changes to both practice and the law. 
It reproduces Change 5 in ITTOIA and so brings the income and corporation tax 
codes back into line. 
 
197. Subsection (4) defines &#8220;rent&#8221;. Section 120 of ICTA uses the definition of 
&#8220;rent&#8221; in section 119(3) of ICTA (rent etc. payable in connection with mines, quarries 
and similar concerns). Section 119 of ICTA is rewritten in Chapter 7 of Part 4 of this 
Bill. The definition of rent in that Chapter and in this clause must be the same. See the 
commentary on clause 271 of this Bill for a fuller description of the rewrite of the 
word &#8220;rent&#8221; in Chapter 7 of Part 4 of this Bill. 
 
198. Subsection (5) defines &#8220;wayleave&#8221;. Section 120 of ICTA uses the word 
&#8220;easement&#8221; as defined in section 119(3) of ICTA to describe the nature of the right for 
which the rent is paid. This clause uses &#8220;wayleave&#8221; as that is how most of the 
payments covered by this clause are usually described in practice. The definition of 
&#8220;easement&#8221; in section 119(3) of ICTA gives that word a meaning that is much wider 
than its usual legal meaning. See the comments of Uthwatt J at pages 329 and 330 of 
Mosley v George Wimpey &#38; Co Ltd (1945), 27 TC 314 CA. 
 
199. The definition of &#8220;wayleave&#8221; preserves the generality of the words in section 
119(3) of ICTA and includes a reference to the Scottish equivalent, &#8220;servitude&#8221;. 
 
200. The definition has no territorial limitation. So the clause covers services other 
than UK electric-line wayleaves. 
 
201. The clause does not rewrite the reference to &#8220;profession or vocation&#8221; in 
Schedule D Case II. See Change 2 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="3" SerialNumber="58">Chapter 3: Trade profits: basic rules 
<Clause Number="46" SerialNumber="59">Clause 46: Generally accepted accounting practice 
202. This clause sets out the starting point for the calculation of trade profits. It is 
based on section 42 of FA 1998. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 
25 of ITTOIA. 
203. Subsection (1) is the general rule that requires profits to be calculated &#8220;in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting practice&#8221;, an expression defined in 
section 50 of FA 2004. In particular, such practice generally requires account to be 
taken of debtors and creditors and of the value of stock. The general rule is subject to 
any special rule of law whether expressed in statute or explained by the courts. 
 
204. The relevant statutory laws are mainly those that are rewritten in this Part. But 
there are also provisions not included in Part 3 of this Bill which may affect the 
calculation of profits: for example, the pension contributions deductions provisions in 
FA 2004 and some anti-avoidance provisions in ICTA that apply to all income types. 
 
205. Subsection (2) makes clear that subsection (1) does not bring with it any of the 
other accounting requirements, such as a formal audit. 
 
206. Subsection (3) sets out exceptions to the general rule in subsection (1). Lloyd&#8217;s 
underwriters have their own special rules (mostly in Chapter 3 of Part 2 of FA 1993); 
there are special rules for insurance companies (mostly in Chapter 1 of Part 12 of 
ICTA and Chapter 1 of Part 2 of FA 1989); and tonnage tax companies (see Schedule 
22 to FA 2000) are subject to &#8220;special rules&#8221; for the calculation of profits. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="47" SerialNumber="60">Clause 47: Losses calculated on same basis as profits 
207. This clause ensures that profits and losses are calculated on a consistent basis. 
It is based on section 46 of FA 1998. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 26 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="48" SerialNumber="61">Clause 48: Receipts and expenses 
208. This clause is based on section 46 of FA 1998. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 27 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="49" SerialNumber="62">Clause 49: Items treated as receipts and expenses 
209. This clause signposts rules affecting trade profits that are elsewhere in the 
Corporation Tax Acts. It is new. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 
28 of ITTOIA. 
 
210. In particular the CAA rules override the rules against the inclusion of capital 
items in clauses 53 and 93 of this Bill. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="50" SerialNumber="63">Clause 50: Animals kept for trade purposes 
211. This clause contains the basic rule for the corporation tax treatment of animals. 
It is based on paragraphs 1, 7 and 9 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 30 of ITTOIA. The animals are treated as trading stock 
unless a herd basis election is made under Chapter 8 of this Part. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="51" SerialNumber="64">Clause 51: Relationship between rules prohibiting and allowing deductions 
212. This clause makes clear the interaction between those provisions that allow a 
deduction and those provisions that prohibit a deduction. It is new. See Change 7 in 
Annex 1. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 31 of ICTA. 
 
213. The general principle is that a rule allowing a deduction takes priority over a 
rule prohibiting a deduction. But this is subject to a number of exceptions. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="52" SerialNumber="65">Clause 52: Apportionment etc of profits and losses to accounting period 
214. This clause provides for apportionment of profits and losses when a 
company&#8217;s period of account does not coincide with an accounting period. It is based 
on section 72 of ICTA. That section is rewritten for income tax purposes in sections 
203 and 871 of ITTOIA. 
 
215. This clause does not carry over the rewrite change in sections 203(4) and 
871(5) of ITTOIA whereby apportionment is permitted by a measure of time other 
than the days permitted by section 72(2) of ICTA. HMRC has a long-established view 
that days cannot be split into accounting periods. That helps prevent exploitation of 
the wider range of reliefs available in the rather different context of corporation tax. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="4" SerialNumber="66">Chapter 4: Trade profits: rules restricting deductions 
Overview 
216. This Chapter contains provisions prohibiting various deductions in calculating 
the profits of a trade or restricting the extent to which such deductions can be made. 
 
<Clause Number="53" SerialNumber="67">Clause 53: Capital expenditure 
217. This clause prohibits deductions for capital expenditure and is based on 
section 74(1)(f) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 33 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
218. It is a long-established and generally accepted principle that capital items are 
ignored in calculating the profits of a trade and the question whether a sum is income 
or capital is ultimately a question of law, not accountancy. For judicial authority for 
this proposition, see, for example the words of Brightman J on page 173 of ECC 
Quarries Ltd v Watkis (1975), 51 TC 153 ChD 1: 
 
       &#8230;unchallenged evidence, or a finding, that a sum falls to be treated as capital or income on principles 
       of correct accountancy practice is not decisive of the question whether in law the expenditure is of a 
       capital or an income nature. 
 
219. A sum which is of a capital nature may however be allowed as a deduction in 
calculating the profits of a trade because of a statutory exception to the general rule on 
the deduction of such items in this clause. See, for example, clause 89 (expenses 
connected with patents). 
 
    STC [1975] 578 
220. In the absence of general agreement on what constitutes capital expenditure 
&#8220;items of a capital nature&#8221; is not defined. 
 
221. Section 74(1)(g) of ICTA is redundant as the deduction of capital employed in 
the improvement of premises is covered by the general prohibition on the deduction of 
&#8220;items of a capital nature&#8221;. So this Bill repeals section 74(1)(g) of ICTA without 
rewriting it. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="54" SerialNumber="68">Clause 54: Expenses not wholly and exclusively for trade and unconnected losses 
222. This clause contains rules for the deduction of expenses and losses in 
calculating the profits of a trade. It is based on section 74(1)(a) (expenses) and (e) 
(losses) of ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 34 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
223. Section 74(1)(a) of ICTA provides that in calculating the profits of a trade no 
deduction is allowed for expenditure which is not incurred &#8220;wholly and exclusively&#8221; 
for the purposes of that trade. This could be construed to mean that if expenditure is 
incurred partly for trade purposes and partly for some other purposes, no part of that 
expenditure can be deducted in arriving at the trade profits. 
 
224. But section 74(1)(c) of ICTA, which prohibits any deduction in respect of the 
rent of premises used for residential or &#8220;domestic&#8221; purposes, provides for the 
apportionment of rent paid for premises used partly as residential accommodation and 
partly for the purposes of a trade. And in practice a deduction is allowed for any 
expenditure which can be apportioned between trade and non-trade expenditure &#8211; for 
example, expenditure on a car used partly for trade and partly for private purposes. 
 
225. There is judicial support for allowing a deduction where expenditure incurred 
for more than one purpose can reasonably be apportioned between expenditure 
incurred for the purpose of the trade and non-trade expenditure. See, for example, 
Lochgelly Iron and Coal Company Ltd v Crawford (1913), 6 TC 267 CS, in which a 
deduction was allowed for part of a subscription to a trade association and Copeman v 
William Flood &#38; Sons Ltd (1941), 24 TC 53 KB, in which the High Court remitted 
the case to the Commissioners to find as a fact whether the remuneration paid to 
certain directors who were also shareholders in the family company was wholly and 
exclusively expended for the purpose of the Company&#8217;s trade, and if not, how much 
of the remuneration was so expended. 
 
226. Conversely, the courts have held that if it is not possible to identify any part of 
the expenditure that is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade, 
no apportionment is possible. See, for example, Mallalieu v Drummond (1983), 57 
TC 330 HL 2 in which no deduction was allowable for clothing worn for warmth and 
decency as well as being required by the taxpayer&#8217;s profession. 
 
227. So subsection (2) of this clause provides for the deduction of any part or 
proportion of expenses incurred partly for the purposes of the trade and partly for 
some other purpose that can be identified as incurred wholly and exclusively for the 
purposes of the trade. Rent on dual purpose accommodation can be apportioned under 
subsection (2) of this clause. So this Bill repeals section 74(1)(c) of ICTA without 
rewriting it. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="55" SerialNumber="69">Clause 55: Bad debts 
228. This clause is based on the rule restricting relief for some debts in section 88D 
of ICTA. It also rewrites the relief in section 89 of ICTA for debts proved 
irrecoverable after a trade is treated as having ceased. See Change 8 in Annex 1. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 35 of ITTOIA. 
 
229. Subsection (2)(a) refers to a deduction &#8220;by way of impairment loss&#8221;. That 
expression is not defined for the purpose of this clause. But clause 476(1) defines 
&#8220;impairment loss&#8221; for the purposes of the loan relationships legislation as &#8220;a debit in 
respect of the impairment of a financial asset&#8221;. &#8220;Impairment&#8221; includes 
&#8220;uncollectability&#8221;. 
 
230. Subsection (2)(b) deals with debts released as part of a &#8220;statutory insolvency 
arrangement&#8221;, which is defined in section 834(1) of ICTA. 
 
231. Subsection (3) provides a definition that clarifies the scope of the clause. All 
money debts (see clause 303) arising in a trade that produce an impairment loss are 
within the loan relationships rules (see clause 479). Even if a money trade debt is 
released as part of a statutory insolvency arrangement any loss on the debt is within 
the extended meaning of &#8220;impairment&#8221; in clause 476(1). 
 
232.      There is a corresponding rule for income from holding an office in clause 970. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="56" SerialNumber="70">Clause 56: Car or motor cycle hire 
233. This clause restricts the amount that a company can deduct in respect of the 
cost of hiring certain cars or motor cycles with a retail price (when new) of more than 
&#163;12,000. The restriction increases in line with the retail price. The clause is based on 
sections 578A and 578B of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 
48 of ITTOIA. 
 
234. Section 578B(1) of ICTA says that for the purposes of section 578A of ICTA 
&#8220;car&#8221; includes a motor cycle. So this clause and clause 57 refer to a &#8220;car or motor 
cycle&#8221; throughout. 
 
    STC [1983] 665 
235. Section 578A(4) of ICTA provides for amounts in respect of hire charges 
brought into account as a receipt of the trade under section 94 of ICTA (see clause 94 
of this Bill) to be reduced in the same proportion as the deduction in respect of those 
charges is reduced under section 578A(3) of ICTA. Subsection (4) of this clause 
extends the same treatment to amounts in respect of hire charges taxed as a post- 
cessation receipt under clause 193 (debts released after cessation). See Change 9 in 
Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="57" SerialNumber="71">Clause 57: Car or motor cycle hire: supplementary 
236. This clause defines various terms and is based on section 578B of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 49 of ITTOIA. 
 
237. Section 578B(2) of ICTA defines &#8220;qualifying hire car&#8221; for the purposes of 
section 578A of ICTA as a car hired under a hire-purchase agreement subject to an 
option to purchase which is exercisable for a nominal amount. 
 
238. Not all hire-purchase agreements require the hirer to exercise an option at the 
end of the hire period. Under some types of agreement, ownership of the vehicle 
passes automatically to the hirer at the end of the hire period. So subsection (2)(a) of 
this clause extends the definition of &#8220;qualifying hire car or motor cycle&#8221; to include a 
car or motor cycle where ownership passes without the exercise of an option to 
purchase. See Change 10 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="58" SerialNumber="72">Clause 58: Hiring cars (but not motor cycles) with low CO2 emissions before 1 
April 2013 
239. This clause excludes certain cars hired before 1 April 2013 under a contract 
entered into before that date from the restriction in clause 56. It is based on section 
578A(2A) and (2B) of ICTA and section 60 of FA 2002. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 50 of ITTOIA. 
 
240. Subsection (2) defines low emissions by reference to section 45D of CAA. A 
transitional rule in Schedule 1 to the Bill provides that, for a car hired on or before 31 
March 2008, the carbon emissions limit in section 45D(4) of CAA remains 120 grams 
instead of the new limit of 110 grams. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="59" SerialNumber="73">Clause 59: Patent royalties 
241. This clause prohibits a deduction for patent royalties. It is based on section 
74(1)(p) of ICTA. 
 
242. For most patent royalties this rule is overridden by the rules of the intangible 
fixed assets regime (rewritten in Part 8 of this Bill) which provide relief for trades as 
well as other commercial activities (see, in particular, clause 728(5) and Chapter 6 of 
Part 8 of this Bill). But for a minority of cases, this clause will remain relevant and 
will continue to prevent a deduction. That includes, for example, cases where the 
royalty is in respect of an intangible asset that is not a fixed asset of the payer&#8217;s trade. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="60" SerialNumber="74">Clause 60: Expenditure on integral features 
243. This clause draws attention to the rule in section 33A(3) of CAA. There is a 
signpost to that rule in section 74(1)(da) of ICTA. That subsection is repealed. The 
signpost is not formally rewritten but it is replaced in this clause (and in the property 
income clause 263). 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="5" SerialNumber="75">Chapter 5: Trade profits: rules allowing deductions 
Overview 
244. This Chapter contains provisions allowing various deductions in calculating 
the profits of a trade. 
 
<Clause Number="61" SerialNumber="76">Clause 61: Pre-trading expenses 
245. This clause gives relief for expenses incurred before a trade starts. It is based 
on section 401 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 57 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
246. Subsection (1) sets the scene. Consistent with other rules in this Part, it refers 
to the &#8220;date&#8221; on which (instead of the &#8220;time&#8221; when) a company starts to trade. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="62" SerialNumber="77">Clause 62: Tenants under taxed leases: introduction 
247. This clause provides for the following five clauses to apply where a tenant, 
under a taxed lease, uses land for the purposes of a trade. It is based on section 87(1), 
(2), (8) and (9A) of ICTA. The corresponding provision for income tax is in section 
60 of ITTOIA. 
 
248. Chapter 4 of Part 4 (profits of property businesses: lease premiums etc) 
contains provisions (in clauses 217 to 222) treating certain premiums, and other 
amounts, relating to a lease (&#8220;the taxed lease&#8221;) as giving rise to receipts of a property 
business (of amount X). Chapter 4 of Part 4 also provides that in certain cases a tenant 
under the taxed lease obtains relief in respect of all, or part, of X: 
 
    &#8226; by reducing the amount of another property business receipt (clauses 227 to 
       230), or 
 
    &#8226; by being treated as an expense of a property business (clauses 231 to 234). 
 
249. Clauses 62 to 67 provide for certain cases in which a tenant under the taxed 
lease obtains relief as a trading expense in respect of all, or part, of X. 
 
250. Subsection (1) extends relief to cases in which X arose in relation to a lease of 
land outside the United Kingdom. See Change 11 in Annex 1. This is in accordance 
with the policy of treating UK and overseas property businesses in the same way as 
far as possible. 
251. The amount which a tenant can deduct in respect of rent which it is treated as 
paying under section 87(2) of ICTA is qualified by: 
 
    &#8226; the general rules as to deductions not allowable in computing the profits of a 
       trade in section 74(1) of ICTA; and 
 
    &#8226; rules prohibiting or restricting the deduction of specific expenditure elsewhere 
       in ICTA. 
 
252. In this Bill, the rules restricting deductions are in Chapter 4 of this Part and 
section 74(1)(a) of ICTA is rewritten in that Chapter in clause 54. Subsection (3) 
preserves the interaction of section 87(2) of ICTA and the general and specific rules 
restricting deductions in ICTA by providing that a deduction for an expense which a 
tenant is treated as incurring under clause 63 is subject to the application of any 
provision of Chapter 4 of this Part. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="63" SerialNumber="78">Clause 63: Tenants occupying land for purposes of trade treated as incurring 
expenses 
253. This clause treats a tenant under a lease, in respect of which an amount is 
brought into account by the landlord, (a &#8220;taxed lease&#8221;) as incurring an expense for 
each day on which the property held under the lease is occupied for the purposes of 
the tenant&#8217;s trade. It is based on section 87(2), (3) and (9) of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 61 of ITTOIA. 
 
254. Clauses 217 to 222 provide for a company to bring an amount into account as 
a receipt of a property business in cases where the company has granted a short-term 
lease at a premium (or in certain other cases). 
 
255. Sections 277 to 282 of ITTOIA make corresponding provision for a person to 
bring an amount into account as a receipt of a property business for income tax. 
 
256. Subsection (1) treats a tenant which, for a qualifying day, occupies land for the 
purposes of a trade as incurring an expense. This corresponds to the treatment of the 
landlord who has been, or would have been (see clause 227(4)), treated as receiving a 
receipt (&#8220;taxed receipt&#8221;) of the landlord&#8217;s property business. 
 
257. The formula in subsection (4) calculates the expense for each qualifying day 
by spreading an amount in respect of the taxed receipt evenly over the receipt period 
of that receipt. Defining &#8220;A&#8221; in that formula as &#8220;the unreduced amount of the taxed 
receipt&#8221; makes clear that the amount of the expense which the tenant is treated as 
incurring for each qualifying day is calculated by reference to the amount of the taxed 
receipt before any reductions or deductions. 
 
258. Subsection (5) modifies that formula for a qualifying day on which the tenant 
occupies only part of the land subject to the taxed lease for the purposes of a trade. 
The subsection requires the fraction of the land which is occupied by the tenant for the 
purposes of the trade to be calculated &#8220;on a just and reasonable basis&#8221;, where section 
87(3) of ICTA requires a &#8220;just apportionment&#8221;. See Change 12 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="64" SerialNumber="79">Clause 64: Limit on deductions if tenant entitled to mineral extraction allowance 
259. This clause prevents a double deduction where a tenant is entitled under 
section 403 of CAA to an allowance in respect of qualifying expenditure on acquiring 
a mineral asset. It is based on section 87(7) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 62 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="65" SerialNumber="80">Clause 65: Tenants dealing with land as property employed for purposes of trade 
260. This clause applies to a tenant which, while not occupying a property, uses the 
property for the purposes of a trade &#8211; for example a company which lets premises held 
under a taxed lease to a person who sells only goods supplied by that company. It is 
based on section 87(4) and (6) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 63 of ITTOIA. 
 
261. Subsection (2) treats the tenant as if it occupied the property, or part of it, for 
the purposes of relief under clause 63. 
 
262. Subsection (3) prevents the tenant obtaining relief under clause 63 to the 
extent that relief for the same day is allowed in calculating the profits of the tenant&#8217;s 
property business under clause 232. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="66" SerialNumber="81">Clause 66: Restrictions on section 63 expenses: lease premium receipts 
263. This clause restricts the expenses that clause 65 treats a tenant as incurring, 
under clause 63, by reference to the unreduced amount of a taxed receipt under a 
taxed lease if: 
 
    &#8226; a sublease has been granted out of the taxed lease; and 
 
    &#8226; in respect of the sublease, the unreduced amount of the taxed receipt reduces 
       an amount which is brought into account as a receipt under Chapter 4 of Part 4 
       of this Bill or the corresponding provisions in ITTOIA (the &#8220;lease premium 
       receipt&#8221;). 
 
This clause is based on sections 87(5) and 87A of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 64 of ITTOIA. 
 
264. The restriction in this clause extends to cases where the unreduced amount of 
the taxed receipt reduces a lease premium receipt of an overseas property business. 
See Change 11 in Annex 1. 
 
265. Clause 63 treats the tenant as incurring an expense for each qualifying day in 
the receipt period of the taxed receipt relating to the taxed lease. The expense is 
calculated by reference to the unreduced amount of the taxed receipt. 
266. If, in respect of the sublease, the unreduced amount of the taxed receipt is used 
to reduce: 
 
    &#8226; under clause 228, the amount brought into account as a lease premium receipt 
       under Chapter 4 of Part 4 of this Bill; or 
 
    &#8226; under section 288 of ITTOIA, the amount brought into account as a lease 
       premium receipt under Chapter 4 of Part 3 of ITTOIA, 
 
this clause makes a corresponding reduction to the amount of the expense which 
clause 63 treats as incurred by the tenant for a qualifying day in the receipt period of 
the lease premium receipt. 
 
267. Subsections (3) to (5) treat the tenant as incurring an expense for a qualifying 
day of the amount, if any, by which the &#8220;daily amount&#8221; of the taxed receipt exceeds: 
 
    &#8226; the &#8220;daily reduction&#8221; of the lease premium receipt; or 
 
    &#8226; if the qualifying day falls within the receipt period of more than one lease 
       premium receipt, the &#8220;total of the daily reductions&#8221; of those lease premium 
       receipts. 
 
268. This corresponds to the treatment in clause 233 of cases where lease premium 
receipts, with overlapping receipt periods, are reduced by reference to the unreduced 
amount of a single taxed receipt. See Change 13 in Annex 1. 
 
269. Subsection (6) contains formulas for calculating the &#8220;daily amount&#8221; of a taxed 
receipt and the &#8220;daily reduction&#8221; of a lease premium receipt. The subsection provides 
that the &#8220;daily reduction&#8221; only takes account of the taxed receipt in question. This 
corresponds to the treatment in clause 233 of cases where more than one taxed receipt 
reduces a single lease premium receipt. See Change 13 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="67" SerialNumber="82">Clause 67: Restrictions on section 63 expenses: lease of part of premises 
270. This clause adapts clause 63 if clause 66 applies but the sublease does not 
extend to the whole of the premises subject to the taxed lease. It is based on sections 
87(5) and 87A of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 65 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
271. Subsection (4) deals with the case where, for a qualifying day, there is more 
than one lease premium receipt, relating to subleases that do not extend to the whole 
of the premises, that has been reduced by the taxed receipt. This corresponds to the 
treatment in clause 234(5) of expenses under clauses 232 and 233 where more than 
one lease premium receipt falls to be reduced by reference to the same taxed receipt. 
See Change 13 in Annex 1. 
272. Subsection (5) adapts the formulas in clauses 63(4) and 66(6) by multiplying 
the unreduced amount of the taxed receipt in those formulas (&#8220;A&#8221;) by the fraction of 
the premises to which the sublease relates. 
 
273. Subsection (6) requires the fraction in subsection (5) to be calculated &#8220;on a just 
and reasonable basis&#8221;, where section 87(5) of ICTA, which applies section 37(6) of 
ICTA, is not explicit about the necessary basis of apportionment. See Change 12 in 
Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="68" SerialNumber="83">Clause 68: Replacement and alteration of trade tools 
274. This clause allows a deduction for the cost of replacing or altering trade tools 
if the only reason a deduction would not be allowed is that the expenditure is of a 
capital nature. It is based on that part of section 74(1)(d) of ICTA which relates to 
deductions in respect of the replacement (&#8220;supply&#8221;) or alteration of implements, 
utensils or other articles employed for the purposes of the trade. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 68 of ITTOIA. 
 
275. Expenditure on repairing trade premises or tools is revenue under the normal 
rules. And following the Special Commissioners decision in Jenners Princes Street 
Edinburgh Ltd v CIR (1998), SpC000166 3, it is generally accepted that the reference 
in section 74(1)(d) of ICTA to expenditure &#8220;beyond the sum actually expended&#8221; does 
not prohibit the deduction of a provision for repairs if the cost of the repairs would be 
allowable. So that part of section 74(1)(d) of ICTA which deals with repairs is 
redundant and is not rewritten. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="69" SerialNumber="84">Clause 69: Payments for restrictive undertakings 
276. This clause allows a company to deduct certain amounts paid to employees for 
restrictive undertakings. Such amounts might not otherwise be deductible to the extent 
that they are capital in nature or fall foul of the &#8220;wholly and exclusively&#8221; rule. The 
clause is based on section 73(2) of FA 1988. The corresponding rule for income tax is 
in section 69 of ITTOIA. 
 
277. Section 73(2) of FA 1988 applies only to amounts brought into charge on the 
employee as earnings under section 225 of ITEPA. The former cross-refers to the 
latter where the definition of the amounts concerned is set out: 
 
       In this section &#8220;restrictive undertaking&#8221; means an undertaking which restricts the individual&#8217;s conduct 
       or activities. 
 
       For this purpose it does not matter whether or not the undertaking is legally enforceable or is qualified. 
 
278. Subsection (1) provides for the deduction. In so doing it focuses on the key 
element for the rule to apply: the fact of payment. 
 
    STC [1998] (SCD) 196 
279. Subsection (2) provides a timing rule. The deduction allowed by section 73 of 
FA 1988 is taken in the accounting period in which the payment is made and no 
deduction is allowed in any other period. Similar words are used in clauses 77 and 88. 
This ensures that the timing rules for deductions in this Chapter which depend on 
payment are explicit and consistent. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="70" SerialNumber="85">Clause 70: Employees seconded to charities and educational establishments 
280. This clause allows a company carrying on a trade to deduct the cost of an 
employee seconded to a charity or educational establishment in calculating the trade 
profits. It is based on section 86 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 70 of ITTOIA. 
 
281. Section 86 of ICTA allows a company which seconds an employee to a charity 
or educational establishment to deduct the cost of employing the seconded person to 
the extent that those costs would have been deductible if the employee continued to be 
employed for the purposes of the employer&#8217;s trade. This clause allows the employer to 
deduct all costs attributable to the seconded employee during the period of the 
secondment, regardless of whether those costs would have been allowed if the 
employee had not been seconded. See Change 14 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="71" SerialNumber="86">Clause 71: Educational establishments 
282. This clause defines &#8220;educational establishment&#8221; for the purposes of clause 70. 
It is based on section 86 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 
71 of ITTOIA. 
 
283. Section 86(4)(c) of ICTA refers to an independent school registered under 
section 465 of the Education Act 1996. Section 465 of the Education Act 1996 was 
repealed by the Education Act 2002. So subsection (1)(c) of this clause refers instead 
to an independent school registered under section 161 of the 2002 Act. 
 
284. Schedule 1 to this Bill makes corresponding amendments to section 71 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="72" SerialNumber="87">Clause 72: Payroll deduction schemes: contributions to agents&#8217; expenses 
285. This clause allows an employer a deduction for expenses incurred in operating 
a payroll deduction scheme. It is based on section 86A of ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 72 of ITTOIA. 
 
286. The main rules for payroll deduction schemes are found in Part 12 of ITEPA. 
Under such a scheme an employer deducts charitable donations from employees&#8217; 
salaries and pays them to an agent, who distributes them to the employees&#8217; chosen 
charities. 
 
287. The agent&#8217;s administrative costs may be deducted from the donations. But 
many employers voluntarily pay the costs themselves so that the employees&#8217; full 
donations can go to the chosen charities. 
288. Normally, payments made voluntarily to meet someone else&#8217;s expenses are not 
made wholly and exclusively for the purposes of a trade and therefore would not be 
deductible. Employers might get relief for donations to charitable agencies under the 
Gift Aid scheme. But there are restrictions on the operation of that scheme and relief 
would not be available if the agent was not itself a charity. 
 
289.   This clause gives relief for the expenses as a trading deduction. 
 
290. The clause does not rewrite the reference to &#8220;profession or vocation&#8221; in 
Schedule D Case II. See Change 2 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="73" SerialNumber="88">Clause 73: Counselling and other outplacement services 
291. This clause allows a deduction for certain expenses of counselling provided 
for employees. It is based on sections 589A and 589B of ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 73 of ITTOIA. 
 
292. Subsection (3) cross-refers to ITEPA for the conditions that need to be met for 
the deduction to be allowed (section 310 of ITEPA exempts the employee from tax in 
respect of counselling received). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="74" SerialNumber="89">Clause 74: Retraining courses 
293. This clause allows a deduction for certain expenses of retraining provided for 
employees. It is based on section 588 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax 
is in section 74 of ITTOIA. 
 
294. Subsection (2) cross-refers to ITEPA for the conditions that need to be met for 
the deduction to be allowed (section 311 of ITEPA exempts the employee from tax in 
respect of qualifying retraining courses). 
 
295. The clause does not rewrite section 588(3)(b) of ICTA. That provision makes 
a deduction in calculating the employer&#8217;s trade profits conditional on the employee&#8217;s 
exemption under section 311 of ITEPA in respect of the expenditure in question. This 
condition is not consistent with the similar provision rewritten in clause 73 and does 
not serve any material purpose. See Change 16 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="75" SerialNumber="90">Clause 75: Retraining courses: recovery of tax 
296. This clause allows the recovery of tax when a deduction under clause 74 
proves to have been wrongly allowed. It is based on section 588 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 75 of ITTOIA. 
 
297. Subsection (2), like clause 74(2) of this Bill, cross-refers to the relevant 
provisions in ITEPA to refer to the conditions that have not been met. 
</Clause><ClauseRange start="76" end="81">Clauses 76 to 81: Redundancy payments etc 
Overview 
298. These six clauses are based on the trading income rules relating to redundancy 
payments in sections 90, 579 and 580 of ICTA. The rules that deal with the 
employee&#8217;s liability are in section 309 of ITEPA. The corresponding rules for income 
tax are in sections 76 to 80 of ITTOIA. 
 
299. The trading income rules were introduced to reverse the decisions in CIR v 
Anglo Brewing Co Ltd (1925), 12 TC 803 and Godden v A Wilson&#8217;s Stores 
(Holdings) Ltd (1962), 40 TC 161. In those cases the courts held that certain 
payments to employees on the closing down of a trade were not deductible in arriving 
at trading profits. In neither case was the payment made in accordance with a pre- 
existing obligation. 
 
300. In 1999 HMRC announced (Tax Bulletin 39G, February 1999) that they would 
be guided by the decision in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Cosmotron 
Manufacturing Co Ltd (1997), 70 TC 292 4. 
 
301. In that Hong Kong case the Privy Council decided that redundancy payments 
made under a pre-existing obligation are deductible. Although that decision is merely 
persuasive in the United Kingdom, HMRC do not argue that payments made under a 
pre-existing obligation (including a statutory obligation) are covered by the Anglo 
Brewing and Wilson&#8217;s Stores decisions. The announcement in Tax Bulletin means 
that it may not be necessary to give the employer a statutory right to a deduction in 
calculating trading profits. But these clauses put the matter beyond doubt. 
 
</ClauseRange><Clause Number="76" SerialNumber="91">Clause 76: Redundancy payments and approved contractual payments 
302. This clause sets out the circumstances in which the following three clauses 
apply and explains the terms used in the main provisions. It is based on section 579 of 
ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 76 of ITTOIA. 
 
303. The clauses retain the label &#8220;redundancy payment&#8221; (from section 579 of 
ICTA) and the expression &#8220;additional payment&#8221; (from section 90 of ICTA). This 
clause also introduces the label &#8220;approved contractual payment&#8221; to describe the 
payments that may replace redundancy payments in some cases. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="77" SerialNumber="92">Clause 77: Payments in respect of employment wholly in employer&#8217;s trade 
304. This clause sets out the main rule governing redundancy payments made by an 
employer. It is based on section 579 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax 
is in section 77 of ITTOIA. 
 
305. If a payment is otherwise allowable (possibly as a result of the Cosmotron 
decision &#8211; see the overview for this group of clauses), this clause does not interfere 
 
    STC [1997] 1134 
with the accountancy treatment of the payment. In that case, the normal accounting 
basis applies. 
 
306. The deduction allowed by section 579 of ICTA is for &#8220;a redundancy payment 
... made&#8221;. It is clear that a deduction is allowed only if a payment has been made. It 
follows that the deduction is to be taken in the accounting period in which the 
payment is made and that no deduction is allowed in any other period. 
 
307. Section 579(2)(b) of ICTA sets out the rule that applies if a redundancy 
payment is made after the discontinuance of the employer&#8217;s trade. The rule applies if 
the company ceases to carry on a trade or to be within the charge to corporation tax 
(see clause 41 of this Bill). 
 
308. In the case of a trade carried on by a company in partnership, section 114(1)(c) 
of ICTA deals with a change of membership of a partnership. The profits of the trade 
are calculated as if there is a transfer of the trade from one deemed company to 
another, unless a particular company carries on the trade before and after the change. 
Such a transfer means that the first deemed company ceases to carry on the trade. This 
brings it within the rule in section 579(2)(b) of ICTA. 
 
309.   Subsection (5) of the clause sets out the partnership rule. 
 
310. Subsection (6) has a timing rule expressed in words similar to those used in 
clauses 69 and 88 of this Bill. This ensures that the timing rules for deductions in 
Chapter 5 of Part 3 of this Bill which depend on payment are explicit and consistent. 
This special timing rule applies if the payment is allowable only as a result of this 
clause. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="78" SerialNumber="93">Clause 78: Payments in respect of employment in more than one capacity 
311. This clause deals with the case where the employee is employed in more than 
one capacity. It is based on section 579 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income 
tax is in section 78 of ITTOIA. The clause covers the case where there is a non-trade 
element in the employment and makes clear what part of the payment is allowed as a 
deduction in calculating trade profits. 
 
312. Section 579(5) of ICTA does not specify the basis on which to apportion the 
payment. This clause adopts the &#8220;just and reasonable&#8221; apportionment that is used 
consistently in this Bill. See Change 12 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="79" SerialNumber="94">Clause 79: Additional payments 
313. This clause deals with any voluntary payments that an employer makes in 
addition to the statutory (or approved) payments dealt with in clause 77. It is based on 
section 90 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 79 of 
ITTOIA. 
314. Unlike the payments in clause 77, these additional payments are allowable 
only if the sole reason for their disallowance is the cessation of the trade. 
 
315. The clause applies to payments in connection with the cessation of part of a 
trade in the same way as it applies to payments in connection with the cessation of a 
whole trade. See Change 17 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="80" SerialNumber="95">Clause 80: Application of section 79 in cases involving partnerships 
316. This clause clarifies what happens on a change of partnership. It is based on 
sections 90 and 114 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 79A 
of ITTOIA (inserted by Schedule 1 to this Bill). 
 
317. Section 90(3) of ICTA refers to the &#8220;discontinuance&#8221; of a trade. That word has 
to be interpreted in the light of sections 114 and 337 of ICTA: the trade is not treated 
as discontinued unless there is a complete change in the companies carrying it on. 
 
318. A redundancy payment is not disallowable solely on account of a partial 
change of companies carrying on a trade. This clause puts it beyond doubt that a 
partial change of companies carrying on a trade does not count as a cessation. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="81" SerialNumber="96">Clause 81: Payments made by the Government 
319. This clause sets out what happens if it is not the employer who makes the 
redundancy payment to the employee. It is based on section 579 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 80 of ITTOIA. 
 
320. In some cases the Government makes the payment and is reimbursed by the 
employer. This clause ensures that the employer is allowed a trading deduction. 
 
321. The references in ICTA to section 166 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 
and Article 201 of the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (SI 
1996/1919 (NI 16)) are corrected to section 167 and Article 202. 
 
322. Subsection (1)(b) reflects the effect of the devolution settlements. See Change 
15 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="82" SerialNumber="97">Clause 82: Contributions to local enterprise organisations or urban regeneration 
companies 
323. This is the first of five clauses that allow deductions for contributions to local 
enterprise agencies, training and enterprise councils, local enterprise companies in 
Scotland, business links and urban regeneration companies. The clauses are based on 
sections 79, 79A and 79B of ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in 
sections 82 to 86 of ITTOIA. 
 
324. Contributions to these bodies are generally donations and are likely to be made 
for benevolent reasons, rather than wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the 
trade (see clause 54 of this Bill). 
325. Subsection (3) is an anti-avoidance rule. It prevents a company using the 
clause to obtain a deduction for non-trade expenditure, such as funding the training of 
a member of a shareholder&#8217;s family, by passing funds through one of these bodies. 
The source legislation disallows any deduction if there is a benefit to the company (or 
a connected person). This clause merely restricts the deduction by the value of the 
benefit. See Change 18 in Annex 1. 
 
326. Subsections (5) and (6) set out what happens if the company (or a connected 
person) receives a benefit in connection with the contribution. The charge on the 
benefit applies if the benefit is received by a person &#8220;connected with&#8221; the company. 
That expression is explained in clause 1316. 
 
327. Subsection (6)(b) deals with the case where the recipient&#8217;s trade has ceased 
before the benefit is received. It treats the benefit explicitly as a post-cessation receipt. 
See Change 19 in Annex 1. 
 
328. Subsection (7) makes clear the extent of the disallowance under subsection (3) 
or charge under subsection (6). 
 
329. The subsection limits the &#8220;disqualifying benefit&#8221; in accordance with HMRC 
practice. See Change 18 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="83" SerialNumber="98">Clause 83: Meaning of &#8220;local enterprise organisation&#8221; 
330. This clause lists some of the organisations that qualify for deductions to be 
allowed under clause 82. It is based on the definitions in sections 79(4) and 79A(5) of 
ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 83 of ITTOIA. 
 
331. Subsection (2) deals with local enterprise agencies. These agencies may take a 
number of forms and do not have an approval procedure for any other purpose. So the 
tax legislation specifies that they must be approved for this purpose. 
 
332. The subsection introduces the expression &#8220;relevant national authority&#8221;. The 
expression is used also in clauses 84 and 85. 
 
333. The subsection reflects the effect of the devolution settlements. See Change 15 
in Annex 1. The National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (SI 
1999/672) devolves the functions of the Secretary of State under section 79 of ICTA 
to the National Assembly for Wales. So the &#8220;relevant national authority&#8221; may be the 
Assembly. But the Order does not refer to section 79A of ICTA. So the equivalent 
functions in subsections (3) and (5) of this clause are still exercised only by the 
Secretary of State. 
 
334. Subsections (3) to (5) deal with other bodies to which clause 82 applies. These 
other bodies have to be set up in a particular way for other reasons and the tax 
legislation merely follows the existing procedures. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="84" SerialNumber="99">Clause 84: Approval of local enterprise agencies 
335. This clause and clause 85 set out the detailed rules that apply for the approval 
of local enterprise agencies and the withdrawal of such approval. They are based on 
section 79 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 84 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
336. The clause sets out the basic procedure for approving a local enterprise 
agency. The references to &#8220;relevant national authority&#8221; are explained in clause 83(2). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="85" SerialNumber="100">Clause 85: Supplementary provisions with respect to approvals 
337. This clause and clause 84 set out the detailed rules that apply for the approval 
of local enterprise agencies and the withdrawal of such approval. They are based on 
section 79 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 85 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
338. The references to &#8220;relevant national authority&#8221; in this clause are explained in 
clause 83(2). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="86" SerialNumber="101">Clause 86: Meaning of &#8220;urban regeneration company&#8221; 
339. This clause sets out the detailed rules that apply for the designation of urban 
regeneration companies. It is based on section 79B of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 86 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="87" SerialNumber="102">Clause 87: Expenses of research and development 
340. This clause gives relief for the cost of research and development undertaken 
by or on behalf of a company carrying on a trade. It is based on section 82A of ICTA. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 87 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="88" SerialNumber="103">Clause 88: Payments to research associations, universities etc 
341. This clause gives relief for payments by a company carrying on a trade to 
various bodies engaged in scientific research. It is based on section 82B of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 88 of ITTOIA. 
 
342. The amendments to section 82B of ICTA in section 15 of F(No 2)A 2005 have 
effect in relation to sums paid to an association within subsection (1)(a) of this clause 
during any accounting period of the association beginning on or after a day to be 
appointed by the Treasury under section 13(6) of F(No 2)A 2005. 
 
343. Section 82B(1) of ICTA allows a deduction for &#8220;the sum paid&#8221;. So subsection 
(2) allows a deduction for the accounting period in which the payment is made. The 
wording is similar to that used in clauses 69 and 77. This ensures that the timing rules 
for deductions in Chapter 5 of this Part of this Bill which depend on payment are 
explicit and consistent. 
 
344. Section 82B(4) of ICTA provides that &#8220;the Board&#8221; shall refer any question as 
to whether, or to what extent, activities constitute scientific research for the purposes 
of section 82B to the Secretary of State. Section 832(1) of ICTA defines &#8220;the Board&#8221; 
as &#8220;the Commissioners of Inland Revenue&#8221;. 
 
345. In practice, the function in section 82B of ICTA is exercised by an officer of 
Revenue and Customs. So subsection (6) of this clause provides that any question as 
to what constitutes scientific research must be referred to the Secretary of State by &#8220;an 
officer of Revenue and Customs&#8221;. This Change corresponds to Part B of Change 149 
in ITTOIA (as amended by CRCA) and so brings the income tax and corporation tax 
codes back into line. See Change 1 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="89" SerialNumber="104">Clause 89: Expenses connected with patents 
346. This clause allows a deduction for expenses connected with patents. It is based 
on section 83 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 89 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
347. The clause sets out the expenses that are allowable. The deduction is on the 
basis of expenses incurred. This relaxes any requirement in the source legislation that 
fees have to be paid before a deduction can be made. See Change 20 in Annex 1. 
 
348. For most expenses connected with patents this rule is overridden by the rules 
of the intangible fixed assets regime (rewritten in Part 8 of this Bill) which provide 
relief for trades as well as other commercial activities (see Chapter 6 of that Part). 
But, for a minority of cases, this clause remains relevant and allows a deduction. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="90" SerialNumber="105">Clause 90: Expenses connected with designs or trade marks 
349. This clause allows a deduction for expenses connected with designs or trade 
marks. It is based on section 83 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 90 of ITTOIA. 
 
350. The clause sets out the expenses that are allowable. The deduction is on the 
basis of expenses incurred. This relaxes any requirement in the source legislation that 
fees have to be paid before a deduction can be made. See Change 20 in Annex 1. 
 
351. For most expenses connected with designs or trade marks this rule is 
overridden by the rules of the intangible fixed assets regime (rewritten in Part 8 of this 
Bill) which provide relief for trades as well as other commercial activities (see 
Chapter 6 of that Part). But, for a minority of cases, this clause remains relevant and 
allows a deduction. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="91" SerialNumber="106">Clause 91: Payments to Export Credits Guarantee Department 
352. This clause allows a company carrying on a trade to deduct the cost of certain 
payments to the Export Credits Guarantee Department (&#8220;ECGD&#8221;). It is based on 
section 88 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 91 of 
ITTOIA. 
353. Section 88 of ICTA refers to payments made under arrangements made by the 
Secretary of State in pursuance of section 11 of the Export Guarantees and Overseas 
Investment Act 1978. This clause refers instead to arrangements made under section 2 
of the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991 which replaced the 1978 Act. 
 
354. Section 13(1) of the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991 delegates the 
functions of the Secretary of State under section 2 of the 1991 Act to the ECGD. So 
the reference to the Secretary of State in section 88 of ICTA is not rewritten in this 
clause. 
 
355. Section 88 of ICTA allows a trader to deduct &#8220;sums paid&#8221; to the ECGD. This 
clause instead allows a deduction for any &#8220;sum payable&#8221; by the trader. See Change 21 
in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="92" SerialNumber="107">Clause 92: Levies etc under FISMA 2000 
356. This clause provides for the inclusion, in a calculation of trading profits, of 
certain payments arising from FISMA. It is based on section 76A of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 155 of ITTOIA. 
 
357. Subsection (1) applies the clause to any company that pays a &#8220;levy&#8221; and 
removes three minor restrictions. 
 
    &#8226; Section 76A of ICTA applies only to an &#8220;authorised person&#8221;. This clause 
       removes that restriction. 
 
    &#8226; The clause does not reproduce the restriction in section 76A(2)(e) of ICTA for 
       some &#8220;costs&#8221;. 
 
    &#8226; A trading company that also has investment business may qualify for a 
       deduction under this clause which is denied by section 76A(1)(b) of ICTA. 
 
See Change 22 in Annex 1. 
 
358. Subsection (1) provides for a deduction. Most FISMA levies would be 
allowable expenses under the basic trade profit calculation rules. The purpose of this 
provision is to deal with the exceptional case where deduction of a levy would 
otherwise be prevented by a prohibitive rule. 
 
359. The expenses allowable are determined by reference to FISMA. Subsections 
(2) and (3) provide the links with FISMA. 
 
360.   There is a similar rule about FISMA repayments in clause 104. 

 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="6" SerialNumber="108">Chapter 6: Trade profits: receipts 
Overview 
361. This Chapter contains provisions on how various receipts are to be treated in 
calculating the profits of a trade. 
 
<Clause Number="93" SerialNumber="109">Clause 93: Capital receipts 
362. This clause is the mirror image of clause 53 (capital expenditure). It is new. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 96 of ITTOIA. 
 
363. Subsection (1) sets out the general rule that items of a capital nature are not to 
be treated as receipts of a trade. 
 
364. It is a long-established principle that capital receipts are ignored in calculating 
tax on income. 
 
365. Subsection (2) disapplies the general rule in subsection (1) where there is 
statutory provision for a capital sum to be taken into account as a receipt in 
calculating the profits of a trade. See, for example, clause 103 (sums recovered under 
insurance policies etc) and the rules in Part 5 (loan relationships), Part 7 (derivative 
contracts) and Part 8 (intangible fixed assets). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="94" SerialNumber="110">Clause 94: Debts incurred and later released 
366. If an amount owed by a company is released, this clause treats the amount 
released as a trading receipt. The clause is based on section 94 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 97 of ITTOIA. 
 
367. Subsection (1)(c) sets out the exception that applies if the debt is released as 
part of a &#8220;statutory insolvency arrangement&#8221;, which is defined in section 834(1) of 
ICTA. 
 
368. The source legislation treats the sum as a receipt &#8220;in the period in which the 
release is effected&#8221;. The clause makes it clear that the period in question is an 
accounting period. If the company is no longer carrying on the trade when the debt is 
released, the amount released is charged to tax as a post-cessation receipt (see clause 
193 of this Bill). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="95" SerialNumber="111">Clause 95: Acquisition of trade: receipts from transferor&#8217;s trade 
369. This clause sets out what happens if a successor to a trade receives a sum that 
arose from the trade when it was carried on by the predecessor. It is based on section 
106 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 98 of ITTOIA. 
 
370. If a sum arises from a trade that has ceased, the usual rule is that the sum is a 
post-cessation receipt (see Chapter 15 of this Part). But, if the right to receive the sum 
is transferred with the trade to a company which takes over the trade, this clause 
applies instead. 
371. Subsection (1) refers to a &#8220;person&#8221; ceasing to carry on a trade. That person 
may be one of the partners in a firm. If a firm ceases to carry on a trade, all its 
partners must also cease. So the clause applies in either case. 
 
372. Subsection (2) treats the sum as a receipt of the successor&#8217;s trade. It is not 
charged on the predecessor. The source legislation treats the sum as a receipt &#8220;in the 
period in which it is received&#8221;. The clause makes it clear that the period in question is 
an accounting period. 
 
373. Different rules apply if the right to receive sums is transferred to a person who 
does not take over the trade (see clause 194 of this Bill). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="96" SerialNumber="112">Clause 96: Reverse premiums 
374. This is the first of a group of five clauses based on section 54 of, and Schedule 
6 to, FA 1999. This legislation was introduced following the decision of the Privy 
Council in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie and another (1998), 72 TC 
639 5. An inducement (a &#8220;reverse premium&#8221;) paid to a tenant to take a lease of land is 
taxed as income in the hands of the tenant. The corresponding rules for income tax are 
in sections 99 to 103 of ITTOIA. 
 
375. Subsection (2) introduces the term &#8220;the recipient&#8221;, which is used throughout 
this group of clauses. 
 
376.      Subsection (3) identifies the transaction which gives rise to a reverse premium. 
 
377. Subsection (4) refers to an interest in land being &#8220;granted&#8221;. This distinguishes 
such a transaction from one in which an interest is assigned. The general rule is that a 
charge to tax on a reverse premium arises on the grant of an interest in land but not on 
its assignment. But assignment can give rise to a charge if the assignor is connected 
with the grantor. 
 
378. The meaning of &#8220;reverse premium&#8221; in this clause is applied for the purpose of 
clause 250 by subsection (6) of that clause. 
 
379. Schedule 2 to this Bill rewrites the transitional provision in section 54(2) of 
FA 1999. These clauses do not apply to pre-1999 reverse premiums. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="97" SerialNumber="113">Clause 97: Excluded cases 
380. This clause brings together the various exclusions from the charge on reverse 
premiums. It is based on paragraphs 5 and 7 of Schedule 6 to FA 1999. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 100 of ITTOIA. 
 
    [1998] STC 1160 
381. Subsection (2) rewrites the rule in paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 to FA 1999 as it 
was before it was repealed by ITTOIA. It is possible for a company to receive a 
reverse premium in connection with a property transaction entered into by an 
individual involving the individual&#8217;s only or main residence. The income tax relief is 
rewritten in section 100(2) of ITTOIA. It was not intended that ITTOIA should 
withdraw this relief from a company. So this subsection restores the position as it was 
before ITTOIA. See Change 23 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="98" SerialNumber="114">Clause 98: Tax treatment of reverse premiums 
382. This clause treats a reverse premium as a revenue receipt, rather than a capital 
item. It is based on paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to FA 1999. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 101 of ITTOIA. 
 
383. If the transaction giving rise to the reverse premium is at arm&#8217;s length there is 
no statutory timing rule; the normal accountancy treatment applies. If the transaction 
is not at arm&#8217;s length, there is a timing rule in clause 99. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="99" SerialNumber="115">Clause 99: Arrangements not at arm&#8217;s length 
384. If a property transaction is not at arm&#8217;s length there is a special timing rule. 
This clause provides that the whole of the reverse premium is taxed when the property 
transaction is entered into. It is based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 6 to FA 1999. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 102 of ITTOIA. 
 
385. Subsection (1) refers to &#8220;connected persons&#8221;. That expression is defined for 
the purpose of this clause in clause 100. 
 
386. Subsection (5) deals with the case where the recipient enters into a property 
transaction for the purposes of a trade but the trade has not yet started. In that case, the 
reverse premium is brought into account when the trade starts. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="100" SerialNumber="116">Clause 100: Connected persons and property arrangements 
387. This clause sets out the special meaning of &#8220;connected persons&#8221; that applies 
for the group of clauses on reverse premiums. The basic definition is in clause 1316, 
which imports the definition of &#8220;connected persons&#8221; in section 839 of ICTA. The 
clause is based on paragraph 8 of Schedule 6 to FA 1999. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 103 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="101" SerialNumber="117">Clause 101: Distribution of assets of mutual concerns 
388. This clause deals with the consequences for a trader of receiving a distribution 
from a mutual concern that is a corporate body. It is based on section 491 of ICTA. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 104 of ITTOIA. 
 
389. Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances in which a distribution may give rise 
to a tax charge. It refers to a distribution out of assets that &#8220;represent profits&#8221; of the 
concern. This is not quite the same as &#8220;assets of a body corporate, other than assets 
representing capital&#8221;, as identified in section 491(1) of ICTA. The difference is that 
the clause excludes assets that represent capital gains of the concern. See Change 24 
in Annex 1. 
 
390. Subsection (2) is the general rule: the distribution is treated as a receipt of the 
trade. 
 
391. Subsection (3) deals with the case where the distribution is received after the 
trade has ceased. The clause treats the distribution explicitly as a post-cessation 
receipt. See Change 19 in Annex 1. 
 
392. In this Part the rules apply to the company carrying on a trade rather than to 
the trade itself. So section 337(1)(a) of ICTA is not needed to treat a trade as ceasing 
when there is a change of company carrying it on. Subsection (3) of this clause 
reproduces the combined effect of section 491(3)(b) and (4) of ICTA. 
 
393. Subsection (5) is a special rule that applies if the right to receive a distribution 
is transferred other than at arm&#8217;s length. Market value is substituted for the actual 
amount received. 
 
394. The clause omits the references to mutual insurance and industrial and 
provident societies in section 491(9) and (11) of ICTA. Those examples were 
intended to help readers but there is no comprehensive definition of &#8220;mutual 
business&#8221;. The subsections were intended to deal with particular doubts which were 
common when the provision was enacted in 1964. Those doubts do not exist today. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="102" SerialNumber="118">Clause 102: Industrial development grants 
395. This clause deals with the treatment of certain grants under the Industrial 
Development Act 1982 or the corresponding provision in Northern Ireland. It is based 
on section 93 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 105 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
396. This clause does not rewrite the references in section 93(2)(a) of ICTA to 
section 7 or 8 of the Industry Act 1972 or in section 93(2)(b) to section 1 of the 
Industries Development Act (Northern Ireland) 1966 and section 4 of the Industries 
Development Act (Northern Ireland) 1971. These enactments were repealed or 
replaced in 1982 and there are no outstanding instalments under the old enactments. 
 
397. Section 93(3) of ICTA disapplies section 93(1) of ICTA in the case of grants 
towards the payment of all or part of a corporation tax liability made under Article 7 
of the Industrial Development (Northern Ireland) Order 1982. Grants in respect of 
corporation tax liabilities cannot be made under any of the enactments listed in 
subsection (1) of this clause other than Article 7 of the Industrial Development 
(Northern Ireland) Order 1982. So subsection (2) excludes all grants in respect of 
corporation tax liabilities. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="103" SerialNumber="119">Clause 103: Sums recovered under insurance policies etc 
398. This clause concerns insurance recoveries. It is based on section 74(1)(l) of 
ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 106 of ITTOIA. 
 
399. Section 74(1)(l) of ICTA prohibits the deduction in computing a trader&#8217;s 
profits of &#8220;any sum recoverable under an insurance or contract of indemnity&#8221;. This is 
regardless of whether the sum is revenue or capital in nature. 
 
400. When a sum is recovered under an insurance policy or contract of indemnity in 
an accounting period other than the accounting period in which the event in respect of 
which it is received occurs, section 74(1)(l) of ICTA requires any deduction made in 
respect of that event to be adjusted to reflect the recovery. 
 
401. This clause provides instead that a capital sum recovered by a trader under an 
insurance policy or a contract of indemnity is brought into account as a receipt in 
calculating the profits of the trade to the extent that the loss or expense has been 
deducted in calculating those profits. This means that the timing of the receipt will 
follow the accountancy treatment. See Change 25 in Annex 1. 
 
402.   No special provision is needed for sums of a revenue nature. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="104" SerialNumber="120">Clause 104: Repayments under FISMA 2000 
403. This clause provides for the inclusion in a calculation of trading profits of 
certain receipts arising from FISMA. It is based on section 76A of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 155 of ITTOIA. 
 
404. Subsection (2) provides for a repayment under FISMA to be treated as a trade 
receipt. Most FISMA repayments would be charged to tax under the basic trade profit 
calculation rules. The purpose of this provision is to deal with the exceptional case 
where the FISMA repayment would not otherwise be a trade receipt. 
 
405. The receipts chargeable are determined by reference to FISMA. Subsections 
(3) and (4) provide the links with FISMA. 
 
406.   There is a similar rule about FISMA levies etc in clause 92. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="7" SerialNumber="121">Chapter 7: Trade profits: gifts to charities etc 
<Clause Number="105" SerialNumber="122">Clause 105: Gifts of trading stock to charities etc 
407. This clause sets out the main rule for gifts of trading stock. It is based on 
sections 83A and 84 of ICTA, which give relief for gifts to charities and educational 
establishments respectively. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 108 
of ITTOIA. 
 
408. When a company disposes of trading stock other than in the course of a trade 
the general rule is that the market value of the stock is taken into account in 
calculating the profits of the trade (see Chapter 10 of this Part of this Bill). This clause 
sets out an exception to this general rule and applies if the company disposes of 
trading stock by way of gift to a charity etc. 
 
409. There is a test for gifts to educational establishments in section 84(1)(a) of 
ICTA concerning the use to which the gift is put in the business of the educational 
establishment. There is no equivalent test in the rules for the relief for gifts to 
charities, in section 83A of ICTA. This clause does not reproduce the condition in 
section 84(1)(a) of ICTA. See Change 26 in Annex 1. 
 
410. Subsection (1) combines the ICTA reliefs for gifts to charities and gifts to 
educational establishments. It includes the extension of the relief to registered clubs in 
Part 3 of Schedule 18 to FA 2002. The relief covers gifts &#8220;for the purposes of&#8221; 
charities etc. See Change 27 in Annex 1. 
 
411. The clause does not require a claim by the company. In this respect, the clause 
is different from section 84(3) of ICTA (but not from section 83A). See Change 28 in 
Annex 1. 
 
412. Subsection (4) does not reproduce the references to the British Museum and 
the Natural History Museum. These bodies are charities within subsection (1)(a) of 
the clause. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="106" SerialNumber="123">Clause 106: Meaning of &#8220;designated educational establishment&#8221; 
413. This clause defines &#8220;designated educational establishment&#8221; for the purpose of 
clause 105. It is based on section 84 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax 
is in section 110 of ITTOIA. 
 
414. Section 84(6) of ICTA provides that &#8220;the Board&#8221; shall refer any question as to 
whether a particular establishment is a designated educational establishment for the 
purposes of the section to the Secretary of State or the Department of Education for 
Northern Ireland. Section 832(1) of ICTA defines &#8220;the Board&#8221; as &#8220;the Commissioners 
of Inland Revenue&#8221; (to be taken as a reference to the Commissioners for Her 
Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, in accordance with section 50(1) of CRCA). 
 
415. In practice, the function in section 84 of ICTA is exercised by an officer of 
Revenue and Customs. So subsection (3) of this clause provides that any question as 
to whether a particular establishment is a designated educational establishment must 
be referred to the Secretary of State by &#8220;an officer of Revenue and Customs&#8221;. See 
Change 1 in Annex 1. 
 
416. The National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (SI 
1999/672) devolves the functions of the Secretary of State under section 84 of ICTA 
to the Welsh Ministers. So this clause refers to the Welsh Ministers (and the 
Assembly). 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="107" SerialNumber="124">Clause 107: Gifts of medical supplies and equipment 
417. This clause sets out the main rule for gifts of medical supplies and equipment. 
It is based on section 55 of FA 2002. It also gives a trading deduction for expenses 
connected with such gifts. 
 
418. As in clause 105, this clause overrides the rule in Chapter 10 of this Part of 
this Bill that the market value of a gift should be treated as a trade receipt. 
 
419. Subsection (3) is the special rule that the costs of getting the medical supplies 
and equipment to the recipient are allowed as a deduction. 
 
420. Subsection (5) is based on section 55(6) of FA 2002. The power of the 
Treasury to exclude certain medical supplies and equipment has not been used. 
 
421. There is no corresponding rule for income tax. So section 55 of FA 2002 is 
repealed by Schedule 1 to this Bill. See Change 29 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="108" SerialNumber="125">Clause 108: Receipt of benefits by donor or connected person 
422. This clause sets out what happens if a company receives a benefit in 
connection with a gift of trading stock or plant and machinery. It is based on sections 
83A and 84 of ICTA and section 55 of FA 2002. The corresponding rule for income 
tax is in section 109 of ITTOIA. 
 
423. Subsection (1) applies the clause if a benefit is received by the company or a 
connected person. Clause 82 of this Bill (contributions to local enterprise 
organisations or urban regeneration companies) uses the same approach. The benefit 
must be in connection with a gift for which relief has been given under clause 105, 
clause 107 or the corresponding capital allowances rule. 
 
424. Subsection (2) extends the recovery charge to a benefit attributable to the costs 
associated with making a gift of medical supplies and equipment. 
 
425. If the donor is still carrying on the trade when the benefit is received the value 
of the benefit is treated as a trading receipt. 
 
426. If the donor has ceased to carry on the trade when the benefit is received the 
value of the benefit is treated as a post-cessation receipt. This treatment replaces the 
general charge under Schedule D Case VI. See Change 19 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="8" SerialNumber="126">Chapter 8: Trade profits: herd basis rules 
Overview 
427. This Chapter gives the rules for what is commonly known as the &#8220;herd basis&#8221;. 
It is based on Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in 
Chapter 8 of Part 2 of ITTOIA. 
428. The object of the herd basis is to treat a herd of animals in a similar fashion to 
a capital asset. Without the election the individual animals in the herd would be 
treated as separate items of trading stock. With the election: 
 
    &#8226; there is no tax allowance for the initial cost of, or any subsequent increase in 
       the size of, the herd; 
 
    &#8226; the net cost of replacing animals in the herd is allowable; 
 
    &#8226; any profit or loss on the sale of a single animal or a small number of animals 
       from the herd without replacement is included in the profits of the trade; and 
 
    &#8226; if the whole, or a substantial part, of the herd is sold and not replaced the 
       resulting profit or loss is not included in the profits of the trade. 
 
429.   An election can be made only in respect of animals kept for their produce. 
 
<Clause Number="109" SerialNumber="127">Clause 109: Election for application of herd basis rules 
430. This clause allows a taxpayer to elect for the &#8220;herd basis rules&#8221; to apply and 
introduces some basic concepts. It is based on paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 9 of Schedule 5 
to ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 111 of ITTOIA. 
 
431. Subsection (1) allows a company or firm of which a company is a member to 
make a &#8220;herd basis election&#8221; if it keeps, or has kept, a &#8220;production herd&#8221;. &#8220;Production 
herd&#8221; is defined in clause 110(1)(c). The effect of a &#8220;herd basis election&#8221; is that the 
&#8220;herd basis rules&#8221; apply. These rules are set out in clauses 112 to 121. The time limits 
for making the election are set out in clauses 122 to 124. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="110" SerialNumber="128">Clause 110: Meaning of &#8220;animal&#8221;, &#8220;herd&#8221;, &#8220;production herd&#8221; etc 
432. This clause provides various definitions used in the Chapter. It is based on 
paragraphs 8 and 9 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax 
are in section 112 of ITTOIA. 
 
433. This clause would be the natural home for the rule in paragraphs 7 and 9(5) of 
Schedule 5 to ICTA that prevents the herd basis rules applying to working animals. 
Paragraphs 7 and 9(5) of Schedule 5 to ICTA exclude certain animals from being part 
of a production herd. These are animals kept for the work they do in connection with 
the trade or those kept for public exhibition, or racing or other competitive purposes. 
This rule is unnecessary because animals in a production herd must be kept wholly or 
mainly for the sake of their produce. So the exclusions are not rewritten. 
 
434. Subsection (1)(a) rewrites the definition of &#8220;animal&#8221; in paragraph 9 of 
Schedule 5 to ICTA. Most of the definitions in paragraph 9 of Schedule 5 to ICTA 
refer to &#8220;animals and other living creatures&#8221;. The main reason for the reference to 
&#8220;other living creatures&#8221; is to make clear that the Schedule applies to birds. 
435. Subsection (1)(c) rewrites the definition of &#8220;production herd&#8221; in paragraph 
8(5) of Schedule 5 to ICTA. Herd basis elections are made by reference to classes of 
production herd. See clause 122. Clause 111(2) identifies when different production 
herds are treated as being of the same class. 
 
436. Subsection (6) makes clear that an immature animal can be treated as added to 
the herd when it becomes mature. There is a definition of maturity for female animals 
in clause 111(5). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="111" SerialNumber="129">Clause 111: Other interpretative provisions 
437. This clause provides further definitions. It is based on paragraphs 3, 8 and 9 of 
Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are section 113 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
438. Subsection (2)(a) applies if production herds of animals of different species 
are kept for the same product; for example, a herd of cows and a herd of goats both 
kept for milk production. Each herd satisfies the definition of production herd. 
Subsection (2)(a) prevents them being treated as of the same class. 
 
439. Subsection (2)(b) prevents animals of the same species being treated as of the 
same class if they are kept for different products; for example, one herd of cows kept 
for milk production and another herd of cows kept for its calves. 
 
440. Subsection (6) clarifies what is meant by &#8220;a substantial part of the herd&#8221;. This 
is a question of fact depending on the circumstances. But 20% of the herd is always 
regarded as substantial. This change clarifies this practice. This change reproduces 
Change 32 in ITTOIA. See Change 30 in Annex 1. 
 
441.   The following clauses refer to &#8220;a substantial part of the herd&#8221;. 
 
    &#8226; Clause 116(1) (sale of animals from the herd); 
 
    &#8226; Clause 117(1) (sale of whole or substantial part of herd); 
 
    &#8226; Clause 118(4) and (5) (acquisition of new herd begun within five years of 
       sale); 
 
    &#8226; Clause 120(1) (replacement of part sold within five years of sale); and 
 
    &#8226; Clause 124(1) (slaughter under disease control order). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="112" SerialNumber="130">Clause 112: Initial cost of herd and value of herd 
442. This clause sets out the treatment of the initial cost, and value, of the herd. It is 
based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax 
is in section 114 of ITTOIA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="113" SerialNumber="131">Clause 113: Addition of animals to herd 
443. This clause sets out the treatment of additions to the herd. It is based on 
paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 115 of ITTOIA. 
 
444. Subsection (1) makes clear that there is a difference between additions, to 
which this clause applies, and replacements dealt with in clause 114. 
 
445. Subsection (2) prevents a deduction for the cost of the additional animal. It is a 
similar rule to clause 112(1). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="114" SerialNumber="132">Clause 114: Replacement of animals in herd 
446. This clause sets out the treatment if an animal in the herd is replaced. It is 
based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax 
is in section 116 of ITTOIA. 
 
447. Subsection (1) introduces the terms &#8220;old animal&#8221; to describe an animal leaving 
the herd and &#8220;new animal&#8221; to describe the animal that replaces it. The circumstances 
in which an animal is treated as sold and the meaning of &#8220;sale proceeds&#8221; are extended 
by the definitions in clause 111(3) and (4). 
 
448. Subsection (4) deals with the deduction due for the replacement animal. The 
basic principle in paragraph 3(4)(b) of Schedule 5 to ICTA is that the cost of the 
second animal is deducted as a trading expense. But paragraph 3(4)(b) of Schedule 5 
to ICTA provides for an exception - &#8220;in so far as that cost consists of such costs as are 
allowable apart from the provisions of this Schedule as deductions in computing 
profits of farming under Case I of Schedule D&#8221;. 
 
449. It is not clear from ICTA what these costs are. In fact the exception is aimed at 
the case where the replacement animal comes from trading stock. Here the costs of 
breeding or acquiring it and, if relevant, rearing it to maturity have already been 
allowed. The farmer is not allowed a double deduction for costs that have already 
been allowed. 
 
450. This clause does not reproduce that part of paragraph 3(4)(b) of Schedule 5 to 
ICTA which refers to the cost of the new animal being subject to paragraph 3(6) of 
Schedule 5 to ICTA. This reference appears to be an error made in the 1988 
consolidation of ICTA. It is generally accepted that it is the rule in paragraph 3(4)(a), 
and not paragraph 3(4)(b), of Schedule 5 to ICTA which should be qualified by 
paragraph 3(6) of Schedule 5 to ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="115" SerialNumber="133">Clause 115: Amount of receipt if old animal slaughtered under disease control 
order 
451. This clause limits the amount of the receipt taxed under clause 114 if the old 
animal is slaughtered under a disease control order. It is based on paragraph 3 of 
Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 117 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
452. Paragraph 3(6) of Schedule 5 to ICTA restricts the amount of the receipt to 
&#8220;the amount allowable as a deduction&#8221;. It is not immediately clear what this amount 
is. This clause makes clear that it is the amount allowable as a deduction in respect of 
the new animal. This is called &#8220;the equivalent amount for the new animal&#8221;. 
 
453. Subsections (4) and (5) define &#8220;the equivalent amount for the new animal&#8221;. 
Subsection (4) deals with the case in which the replacement animal comes from the 
farmer&#8217;s trading stock. Subsection (5) deals with all other cases. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="116" SerialNumber="134">Clause 116: Sale of animals from herd 
454. This clause sets out the rules that apply if an animal is sold from the herd and 
not replaced. It is based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 118 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="117" SerialNumber="135">Clause 117: Sale of whole or substantial part of herd 
455. This is the first of three clauses that set out the rules relating to the sale of all 
or a substantial part of the herd within 12 months. It is based on paragraph 3 of 
Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 119 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
456. The clause merges the rules in paragraph 3(7) to (9) of Schedule 5 to ICTA. 
This Change reproduces Change 33 in ITTOIA. See Change 31 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="118" SerialNumber="136">Clause 118: Acquisition of new herd begun within 5 years of sale 
457. This clause sets out the rules that apply if, following the sale of the herd 
(either all at once or within 12 months), the farmer begins to acquire a new herd 
within five years. It is based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 120 of ITTOIA. 
 
458. Subsection (4) applies if the number of animals in the new herd is smaller than 
the number of animals in the old herd but the difference is not substantial. See Change 
31 in Annex 1. 
 
459. Subsection (7) clarifies what is meant by a &#8220;substantial difference&#8221;. See 
Change 30 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="119" SerialNumber="137">Clause 119: Section 118: sale for reasons outside farmer&#8217;s control 
460. This clause limits the amount taxed as a trade receipt under clause 118 if the 
sale is for reasons outside the farmer&#8217;s control and the replacement animal is of a 
worse quality. It is based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 121 of ITTOIA. 
461. The clause is similar to clause 115 although it is not limited, as that clause is, 
to disposals under a disease control order. The source legislation for both clauses 
refers to the amount of the trading receipt being restricted to &#8220;the amount allowable as 
a deduction&#8221;. It is not immediately clear what this amount is. 
 
462. Subsection (2) makes clear that it is the amount allowable as a deduction in 
respect of the new animal. The clause calls this &#8220;the equivalent amount for the new 
animal&#8221;. 
 
463. Subsections (3) and (4) define &#8220;the equivalent amount for the new animal&#8221;. 
Subsection (3) deals with the case in which the replacement animal comes from the 
farmer&#8217;s trading stock. Subsection (4) deals with all other cases. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="120" SerialNumber="138">Clause 120: Replacement of part sold begun within 5 years of sale 
464. This clause sets out the rules that apply if, following the sale of a substantial 
part of a herd (either all at once or within a year), the farmer begins to replace it 
within five years. It is based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 122 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="121" SerialNumber="139">Clause 121: Section 120: sale for reasons outside farmer&#8217;s control 
465. This clause limits the amount taxed as a trade receipt under clause 120 if the 
sale is for reasons outside the farmer&#8217;s control and the new animal is of a worse 
quality. It is based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 123 of ITTOIA. 
 
466. The clause is similar to clause 115 although it is not limited, as that clause is, 
to disposals under a disease control order. The source legislation for both clauses 
refers to the amount of the trading receipt being restricted to &#8220;the amount allowable as 
a deduction&#8221;. It is not immediately clear what this amount is. 
 
467. Subsection (2) makes clear that it is the amount allowable as a deduction in 
respect of the new animal. The clause calls this &#8220;the equivalent amount for the new 
animal&#8221;. 
 
468. Subsections (3) and (4) define &#8220;the equivalent amount for the new animal&#8221;. 
Subsection (3) deals with the case in which the replacement animal comes from the 
farmer&#8217;s trading stock. Subsection (4) deals with all other cases. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="122" SerialNumber="140">Clause 122: Herd basis elections 
469. This clause sets out the rules for the making of herd basis elections. It is based 
on paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in 
section 124 of ITTOIA. 
 
470. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 to ICTA requires that the election must be made &#8220;in 
writing&#8221; and to an officer of Revenue and Customs. The general rules in Part 7 of 
Schedule 18 to FA 1998 that apply to claims and elections mean it is not necessary to 
repeat these requirements. 
 
471. Subsection (2) sets out the time limits for making the election. The election is 
made by the farmer. The farmer can be a company or a firm in which one of the 
partners is a company. The time limits are different depending on whether the farmer 
is a company or a firm. 
 
472. If the farmer is a firm the same time limit applies whether the partners are all 
income tax payers, all corporation tax payers or a combination of the two. Because of 
the possible involvement of income tax payers the time limit is set by reference to 
income tax years. The time limit in clause 122(2)(b) is the same as that in section 
124(2)(a) of ITTOIA. 
 
473. The different time limits for a company or a firm are reflected in the other two 
clauses that deal with herd basis elections, clauses 123 and 124. Those clauses 
identify the difference by referring to the &#8220;accounting period&#8221; (company) or the 
&#8220;period of account&#8221; (firm). 
 
474. Subsection (4) expands on subsection (1), which provides that an election must 
specify the class of production herd to which it relates. This means separate elections 
must be made for each class of production herd and that an election may not relate to 
more than one class of production herd. Separate elections may be made for different 
classes. 
 
475. Subsection (7) identifies the period for which the herd basis election has effect. 
This depends on whether the farmer is a company (accounting period) or firm (period 
of account). 
 
476. Subsection (8) deals with the case in which the farmer is a firm and there is a 
change in the partners in the firm. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 to ICTA refers to &#8220;the 
farmer making the election&#8221;. If the farming trade is carried on in partnership, the 
&#8220;farmer&#8221; means the firm. If there is a change in the members of a firm, the question 
arises whether there is a new &#8220;farmer&#8221;. Subsection (8) makes clear that there is. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="123" SerialNumber="141">Clause 123: Five year gap in which no production herd kept 
477. This clause deals with the case where there is a period of at least five years 
when the farmer does not keep a production herd of the particular class for which a 
herd basis election has been made. It is based on paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 125 of ITTOIA. 
 
478. Subsection (2) explains the consequences for the herd basis rules if the farmer 
starts to keep another production herd of the same class after the end of the five year 
period. Subsection (2) enacts an extra-statutory practice. See Change 32 in Annex 1. 
This Change reproduces Change 36 in ITTOIA.

Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 126 of 
ITTOIA.

It is based on paragraph 5 of Schedule 5 to ICTA. The corresponding rules for income 
tax are in section 127 of ITTOIA.

<Clause Number="128" SerialNumber="147">Clause 128: Taxation of amounts taken to reserves 
485. This clause contains a special rule for the treatment of securities held by a 
company carrying on a banking or insurance business, or a business of dealing in 
securities, and on which profits and losses are calculated by reference to the &#8220;fair 
value&#8221; of the securities rather than on a realisation basis. It is based on section 472A 
of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 149 of ITTOIA. 
 
486. Financial assets can be dealt with in a number of ways for accounting 
purposes. 
 
487. Where a company dealing in securities uses United Kingdom generally 
accepted accountancy practice (&#8220;UK GAAP&#8221;), profits and losses calculated by 
reference to the fair value of securities treated as trading assets are taken to profit and 
loss account. &#8220;Fair value&#8221; is an accounting term, the meaning of which is broadly 
equivalent to market value. UK GAAP is defined in section 50(4) of FA 2004. 
488. Where a company dealing in securities prepares accounts in accordance with 
international accounting standards, the securities would usually fall to be accounted 
for as at fair value, in accordance with paragraph 9 of International Accounting 
Standard 39 (&#8220;IAS 39&#8221;), and any profits and losses calculated by reference to the fair 
value of securities taken to the profit and loss account. But the company may instead 
account for certain securities as &#8220;available for sale&#8221; if they do not meet the conditions 
for being treated as at fair value through profit or loss. In such a case profits and 
losses calculated by reference to the fair value of securities are taken initially to a 
statement of changes in equity. 
 
489. Since 2005, UK GAAP in this area follows IAS 39. Under UK GAAP the 
profits and losses on &#8220;available for sale&#8221; assets are taken to the statement of total 
recognised gains and losses. 
 
490. Clause 46 of this Bill provides that the calculation of profits or losses from a 
trade must be based on accounts drawn up in accordance with generally accepted 
accountancy practice, subject to any adjustment authorised by law. Implicit in this 
rule is that the profits must appear in the profit and loss account. There is no tax law 
(apart from this clause) which allows profits on equity securities taken to any form of 
reserve to be treated for corporation tax purposes as if they were taken to profit and 
loss account. 
 
491. Subsection (3)(b) provides that subsection (2) does not apply to &#8220;an amount 
recognised for accounting purposes by way of correction of a fundamental error&#8221;. 
This refers to the requirement in International Accounting Standard 8 (Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors) that the correction of a 
fundamental error should be treated as a prior period adjustment. &#8220;For accounting 
purposes&#8221; is defined in section 832(1) of ICTA as &#8220;for the purposes of accounts 
drawn up in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice&#8221;. 
 
492. Section 472A(4)(a) of ICTA defines &#8220;securities&#8221; to include rights, interests or 
options treated as shares for the purposes of sections 126 to 136 of TCGA by virtue of 
sections 135(5) or 136(5) of TCGA. Sections 135(5) and 136(5) of TCGA define 
&#8220;shares&#8221; in the case of a company with no share capital as &#8220;any interests in the 
company possessed by members of the company.&#8221; So subsection (4)(c) of this clause 
defines &#8220;securities&#8221; to include such interests. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="129" SerialNumber="148">Clause 129: Conversion etc of securities held as circulating capital 
493. This clause provides for relief on the conversion or exchange of securities held 
as part of the circulating capital of a company dealing in securities. It is based on 
section 473 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 150 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
494. Section 473(1) of ICTA applies to securities to which a company carrying on a 
banking or insurance business, or a business of dealing in securities, is beneficially 
entitled, the profits from the sale of which would &#8220;form part of the trading profits of 
that business&#8221;. This clause does not stipulate that the company must be beneficially 
entitled to the securities in question. See Change 33 in Annex 1. 
 
495. Subsection (3) excludes securities brought into account at &#8220;fair value&#8221; in 
calculating the profits for the period in which the relevant transaction takes place. 
These are instead dealt with in clause 128. 
 
496. Section 137(1) of TCGA provides that sections 135 and 136 of TCGA do not 
apply to an exchange of shares unless the exchange is: 
 
    effected for bona fide commercial reasons and does not form part of a scheme or arrangements of 
    which the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, is avoidance of liability to capital gains tax or 
    corporation tax. 
 
497. Subsection (7) of this clause adapts the rule in section 137(1) of TCGA to 
include the avoidance of income tax. This covers, for example, a scheme or 
arrangement the purpose of which is the avoidance of income tax by a director of, or 
participator in, the company rather than the avoidance of corporation tax by the 
company itself. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="130" SerialNumber="149">Clause 130: Traders receiving distributions etc 
498. This clause provides that distributions of a UK resident company, and 
payments &#8220;representative of&#8221; such distributions, are brought into account in 
calculating the profits of a trade if those distributions and payments are receipts or 
expenses of the trade on first principles. It is based on section 95 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 366(1) of ITTOIA. 
 
499. A payment &#8220;representative of&#8221; a distribution may arise, for example, if shares 
are on loan at the dividend date. The dividend is received by the person to whom the 
shares are lent. A payment made by that person to compensate the lender for the 
dividend which would have been received if the shares had not been lent &#8220;represents&#8221; 
that dividend. 
 
500. Section 95 of ICTA operates by bringing the distribution or representative 
payment into account in calculating the profits of a company which is a dealer in 
relation to that distribution or payment. That company holds the shares in respect of 
which the distribution is received (or the payment made) as assets on current account 
rather than as investments. 
 
501. Subsections (1) and (2) focus on the nature of the receipt rather than on the 
recipient. Similarly, subsections (3) and (4) focus on the nature of the payment. See 
Change 34 in Annex 1. 
 
502. Clause 1285 of this Bill is the general rule that no liability to corporation tax 
arises on dividends or other distributions of a UK resident company. Subsection (2) of 
this clause disapplies clause 1285 in the case of a UK distribution or a payment 
representing such a distribution. 
 
503. Clause 1305 of this Bill is the general rule that no deduction is allowed in 
respect of a dividend or other distribution. Schedule 23A to ICTA contains special 
rules for the treatment of amounts representative of dividends on UK shares. In 
accordance with paragraph 2(2)(b) of Schedule 23A, a payment representative of a 
UK dividend is treated, in relation to the company by which it is paid, as if it were a 
dividend on its own shares. 
 
504. Subsections (3) and (4) override clause 1305. So a payment representative of a 
UK distribution is to be taken into account in calculating the corporation tax profits of 
the company making the payment. 
 
505. Subsection (3) applies to a payment which would be allowed but for clause 
1305. A payment in respect of which a deduction is disallowed under paragraph 7A of 
Schedule 23A of ICTA is not within subsection (3). So it is not necessary to rewrite 
section 95(1C) ICTA in this clause. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="131" SerialNumber="150">Clause 131: Incidental costs of issuing qualifying shares 
506. This clause allows a deduction to building societies for the incidental costs of 
issuing shares. It is based on section 477B of ICTA. 
 
507. Most shares issued by building societies fall with the loan relationship rules in 
Parts 6 and 7 of this Bill. This is because they are excluded from the definition of 
&#8220;share&#8221; in clause 476(1) of this Bill. The result is that most of the incidental costs 
associated with the issue of the shares are relieved under clause 307 of this Bill. 
 
508. But it is possible for some building society shares not to qualify as loan 
relationships. And, even if they do, some incidental costs may not fall within 
clause 307. So this clause deals with the costs that are not relieved under the loan 
relationship rules. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="132" SerialNumber="151">Clause 132: Dividends etc granted by industrial and provident societies 
509. This clause ensures that a &#8220;divi&#8221; paid by an industrial and provident society is 
allowed as a trading deduction. It is based on section 486 of ICTA. 
 
510. The main rules about industrial and provident societies are in Chapter 5 of Part 
6 of this Bill (loan relationships). 
 
511. A definition of &#8220;registered industrial and provident society&#8221; is inserted into 
section 834(1) of ICTA (see Schedule 1). 
 
512. Subsection (1) sets out the sort of society to which the clause applies. An 
example is an agricultural co-operative that sells (or buys) on behalf its farming 
members. 
513. Subsection (2) is the trading income rule. In practice it is likely that the 
payments with which the clause is concerned would be allowable under the normal 
trading income rule. But this clause puts the matter beyond doubt. 
 
514. The source legislation refers to the calculation of any profits &#8220;for the purpose 
of any provision of the Tax Acts relating to profits chargeable under Case I of 
Schedule D&#8221;. It is probable that the quoted words, read with sections 21A and 21C of 
ICTA, apply the rule for the purpose of a calculation of Schedule A profits. But, in the 
context of a property business, a &#8220;divi&#8221; is not paid &#8220;on account of the recipient&#8217;s 
transactions with the society&#8221;. So in practice the rule does not apply to a property 
business and the clause refers simply to calculating the profits of the trade. 
 
515. Subsection (5) is a signpost to the rule (inserted into ICTA by Schedule 1) that 
the &#8220;divi&#8221; is not a distribution. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="133" SerialNumber="152">Clause 133: Annual payments paid by a credit union 
516. This clause denies a trading deduction for an annual payment made by a credit 
union. It is based on section 487 of ICTA. 
 
517. Most credit unions do not carry on a trade for tax purposes. This is the 
consequence of clause 40. But it is possible that some of the activities of a credit 
union fall outside the scope of the rule in that clause. In that case, a calculation of the 
profits of the trade is required. 
 
518. It is also possible that a credit union carries on a property business. So clause 
210(2) applies the trading income rule to property businesses. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="134" SerialNumber="153">Clause 134: Purchase or sale of woodlands 
519. This clause applies to a person carrying on a trade of dealing in land who buys 
and sells land on which trees are growing. It is based on section 99 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 156 of ITTOIA. 
 
520. Any profit on the sale of the trees and underwood is tax-free because of the 
exemption for the occupation of commercial woodlands. See clause 37 of this Bill. 
Subsection (2) prevents the dealer in land obtaining a trade deduction for that part of 
the cost of the land that is attributable to the cost of the trees. 
 
521. The legislation rewritten by subsection (2) only applies to woodlands 
purchased under a contract entered into on or after 1 May 1963. This limitation is 
preserved in Schedule 2 (transitions and savings). The corresponding provision for 
income tax is paragraph 42 of Schedule 2 to ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="135" SerialNumber="154">Clause 135: Relief in respect of mineral royalties 
522. This clause gives relief if trade receipts include mineral royalties. It is based 
on section 122 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 157 of 
ITTOIA. 
523. Most mineral royalties are taxed under Chapter 7 of Part 4 of this Bill. That 
Chapter rewrites the charge under Schedule D Case VI if rents are received from a 
concern listed in section 55 of ICTA. That list includes mines and quarries. In nearly 
all cases the rents are taxed under Chapter 7 of Part 4 of this Bill as they are not 
received in respect of a trade. But it is possible that the receipt of the rent will be 
incidental to a trade. In that case clause 287 of this Bill provides that the rent is taxed 
under Part 3 of this Bill. This is only likely to happen if the rent is received by a 
property developer in respect of land held as trading stock. 
 
524. The mineral royalties are halved. The relief is rewritten under the italicised 
heading &#8220;dealers in land&#8221; because they are the traders who are most likely to benefit 
from the relief. But the relief is not confined to dealers in land. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="136" SerialNumber="155">Clause 136: Lease premiums etc: reduction of receipts 
525. This clause prevents a person, carrying on a trade of dealing in land, from 
being taxed on all or part of a lease premium, or of certain other amounts received in 
respect of a lease, both as a receipt of the trade under this Part and as a receipt of a 
property business under Part 4 of this Bill. It is based on section 99(2) and (3) of 
ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 158 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="137" SerialNumber="156">Clause 137: Mineral exploration and access 
526. This clause deals with intangible drilling costs of production wells in the oil 
and gas industry. It is based on section 91C of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 161 of ITTOIA. 
 
527. Intangible costs are those which do not result in the acquisition or creation of 
machinery or plant. An example would be the cost of hiring a drilling rig. Production 
wells are wells that are drilled after the presence of oil in an area has been established 
and which are used to extract the oil. 
 
528. Before the enactment of section 91C of ICTA, a deduction was allowed for the 
intangible drilling costs of the second and subsequent production wells in any area. 
This reflected a Special Commissioners decision in 1920 that this expenditure is of a 
revenue nature. This clause disallows a deduction for such costs. It does this by 
denying a deduction for expenditure which, if it had been carried out while exploring 
for oil, would not have been allowed as a deduction. 
 
529. These costs are capital expenditure and qualify for mineral extraction capital 
allowances (see Part 5 of CAA). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="138" SerialNumber="157">Clause 138: Payments by companies liable to pool betting duty 
530. This clause gives a special deduction to companies which pay pool betting 
duty. It is based on those parts of section 126 of FA 1990 and section 121 of FA 1991 
which relate to the calculation of the profits of traders. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 162 of ITTOIA. 
531. In 1990, following the Hillsborough disaster, pool betting duty was reduced on 
condition that the money saved be paid to the Football Trust 1990 to implement Lord 
Justice Taylor&#8217;s recommendations on safety and comfort at football grounds. In 1991 
the duty was reduced again, this time on condition that the money be paid to the 
Foundation for Sport and the Arts, a charitable trust which supports athletic sports and 
games and promotes the arts. The reductions were initially for a limited period, but 
have so far been maintained. 
 
532. Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances in which the clause applies. It 
introduces the expression &#8220;qualifying payment&#8221;. 
 
533. Subsection (2) defines a &#8220;qualifying payment&#8221; to which the clause applies. It 
does not specify that payments in consequence of the 1990 reduction in pool betting 
duty must be paid for football safety and comfort, and that payments in consequence 
of the 1991 reduction must be paid to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. Instead 
the clause applies to a payment for either purpose in consequence of any reduction in 
pool betting duty. See Change 35 in Annex 1. 
 
534. The clause retains a general description of the payments, without identifying 
the bodies which were the targets of the original legislation. It is clear that payments 
made as a consequence of a reduction in pool betting duty to either body would 
qualify for relief under the clause. 
 
535. The source legislation is restricted to the 1990 and 1991 reductions in pool 
betting duty. This clause applies to payments made in consequence of any reduction 
in the duty. See Change 36 in Annex 1. 
 
536. Subsection (3) is the rule that allows the payments as a trading deduction. 
Without this rule the payments might be disallowed because they are not made wholly 
and exclusively for the purposes of the company&#8217;s trade. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="139" SerialNumber="158">Clause 139: Deduction for deemed employment payment 
537. This clause sets out the trading income rules that were originally part of the 
&#8220;IR35&#8221; scheme for the taxation of workers supplied by an intermediary. It is based on 
paragraph 17 of Schedule 12 to FA 2000. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 163 of ITTOIA. 
 
538. The worker is treated as receiving a &#8220;deemed employment payment&#8221; and is 
taxed accordingly (see Chapter 8 of Part 2 of ITEPA). This clause ensures that an 
equivalent amount is allowed as a trading deduction in calculating the profits of the 
intermediary. 
 
539. Subsection (3) is a timing rule. Generally, the deemed employment payment is 
treated as made at the end of the tax year (see section 50(3) of ITEPA). In some 
circumstances the payment is treated as made earlier (see section 57 of ITEPA). In 
either case, the trading deduction is given for the period of account in which the 
payment is treated as made. 
 
540. Subsection (4) is the rule that prevents any double deduction. It caters for the 
possibility that the payment may qualify as a trading deduction on first principles and 
also qualify as a trading deduction in a period of account different from that specified 
in subsection (3). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="140" SerialNumber="159">Clause 140: Special rules for partnerships 
541. This clause sets out two additional rules that apply if a deduction under clause 
139 is to be given in calculating the trading profits of a firm. It is based on paragraph 
18 of Schedule 12 to FA 2000. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 
164 of ITTOIA. 
 
542. Clause 1257 of this Bill explains that &#8220;firm&#8221; is used in this Bill to refer to 
persons carrying on a trade in partnership. It includes a limited liability partnership 
(see clause 1273). 
 
543. Subsection (2) is the rule that a deduction under clause 139 of this Bill cannot 
be used to create a loss in a firm. It operates by reference to the firm&#8217;s period of 
account. See Change 37 in Annex 1. 
 
544. Subsection (3) is the rule that limits the trading deduction to the amount that 
would have been deductible if the worker had been an employee of the intermediary, 
plus a margin to cover the expenses of the firm. 
 
545. In accordance with paragraph 244 of Schedule 6 to ITEPA, &#8220;deemed Schedule 
E payment&#8221; in paragraph 18 of Schedule 12 to FA 2000 is replaced by &#8220;deemed 
employment payment&#8221;. Similarly, in the same paragraph, &#8220;Schedule E&#8221; is replaced by 
&#8220;the employment income Parts of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003&#8221;. 
 
546. But the specific statutory references, such as those to &#8220;paragraph 7&#8221; (of 
Schedule 12 to FA 2000), are covered by the general rule in paragraph 5 of Schedule 
7 to ITEPA. That general rule is that any reference to a repealed provision is to be 
read as a reference to the rewritten provision. 
 
547. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 12 to FA 2000 has been repealed and rewritten as 
section 54(1) of ITEPA. So the reference to that paragraph in paragraph 18 of 
Schedule 12 is to be read as a reference to section 54(1) of ITEPA. This clause 
updates the references to paragraph 7. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="141" SerialNumber="160">Clause 141: Deduction for deemed employment payments 
548. This clause gives a trading deduction if a managed service company (&#8220;MSC&#8221;) 
makes a &#8220;deemed employment payment&#8221; to a worker under section 61D of ITEPA. It 
is based on paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 to FA 2007. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 164A of ITTOIA. 
549. The worker is treated as receiving a &#8220;deemed employment payment&#8221; and is 
taxed accordingly (see Chapter 9 of Part 2 of ITEPA). This clause ensures that an 
equivalent amount (and no more) is allowed as a trading deduction in calculating the 
profits of the MSC. 
 
550. Subsection (5) prevents any double deduction. It caters for the possibility that 
the payment may qualify as a trading deduction on first principles and also qualify as 
a trading deduction in a period of account different from that specified in 
subsection (3). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="142" SerialNumber="161">Clause 142: Deduction for site preparation expenditure 
551. This clause sets out the rules for expenditure on preparing a site so that it can 
be used for waste disposal. It is the first of four clauses that deal with waste disposal. 
They are based on sections 91B and 91BA of ICTA. The corresponding rules for 
income tax are in sections 165 to 168 of ITTOIA. 
 
552. This clause covers expenditure which is not deductible because it is capital 
and which is not eligible for capital allowances; in other words, expenditure that 
would otherwise go unrelieved for corporation tax purposes. 
 
553. Subsection (1) introduces the concept of waste materials being deposited on a 
&#8220;waste disposal site&#8221;, an expression defined in clause 144. 
 
554. Subsection (2) is the link to clause 143, which calculates the amount of 
expenditure that is allowed as deduction. 
 
555. A deduction under section 91B of ICTA is allowed only if the company makes 
a claim (in such form as the Commissioners for HMRC may direct) and submits such 
plans and other documents (if any) as the Commissioners may require. This clause 
drops the requirement for a claim. See Change 38 in Annex 1. 
 
556. Schedule 2 to this Bill rewrites the transitional provision in section 91BA(1) of 
ICTA. Expenditure cannot be &#8220;inherited&#8221; if the site changed hands before March 
2000. 
 
557. Subsection (4) treats the company&#8217;s trade as the same as that of its 
predecessor. This is necessary because the activities taken over may amount to less 
than the whole of the predecessor&#8217;s trade (see subsection (3)(a)). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="143" SerialNumber="162">Clause 143: Allocation of site preparation expenditure 
558. This clause spreads site preparation expenditure over the useful life of the site. 
It is based on section 91B of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 166 of ITTOIA. 
559. Some waste disposal sites, notably in the nuclear waste industry, have 
preparation expenditure dating from before 6 April 1989. So this clause preserves the 
rules for the pre-1989 expenditure. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="144" SerialNumber="163">Clause 144: Site preparation expenditure: supplementary 
560. This clause contains the definitions of the expressions used in the waste 
disposal clauses and sets out the rules for pre-trading expenditure. It is based on 
sections 91A, 91B and 91BA of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 167 of ITTOIA. 
 
561. Although the definitions are expressed to apply &#8220;for the purposes of 
clauses 142 and 143&#8221;, the definition of &#8220;waste disposal licence&#8221; is also used to define 
a &#8220;site restoration payment&#8221; in clause 145(5). 
 
562. In subsection (1)(b) the corresponding Northern Ireland provision is Part 2 of 
the Waste and Contaminated Land (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 (SI 1997/2778 
(N.I.19)). 
 
563. Subsection (1)(c) identifies more specifically the provisions described in 
section 167(1)(c) of ITTOIA. It reflects the amendments to section 91A(6) of ICTA 
made by: 
 
    &#8226; the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations (SI 
       2000/1973); 
 
    &#8226; the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations (SI 2000/323); 
       and 
 
    &#8226; paragraph 3 of Schedule 11 to the Pollution Prevention and Control 
       Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003 (SR 2003/46). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="145" SerialNumber="164">Clause 145: Site restoration payments 
564. This clause deals with payments for the restoration of a site after it has been 
used for waste disposal. It is based on section 91A of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 168 of ITTOIA. 
 
565. In subsection (6)(a), (c) and (d) the corresponding Northern Ireland provision 
is Article 40 of the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 (SI 1991/1220 (N.I. 11)). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="146" SerialNumber="165">Clause 146: Cemeteries and crematoria: introduction 
566. This clause, and the following three clauses, contain special rules for 
companies carrying on a trade of operating a cemetery or crematorium. They are 
based on section 91 of ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in sections 
169 to 172 of ITTOIA. 
567. Without special provisions, no allowance would be due for the cost of land 
sold for interments, memorial gardens attached to crematoria or the surrounding land 
and buildings because expenditure on such land and buildings is in the nature of 
capital. The provisions in clauses 146 to 149 recognise that most land and buildings in 
a cemetery or memorial garden are of little value when the cemetery or memorial 
garden is full. 
 
568. This clause introduces the provisions in clauses 147 to 149 and defines some 
of the terms used in those clauses. 
 
569. Section 91(7)(a) of ICTA adapts the rules for cemeteries in section 91 of ICTA 
to crematoria and treats &#8220;land which is devoted wholly to memorial garden plots&#8221; as a 
cemetery, or as land in a cemetery. Subsection (1) of this clause instead includes the 
carrying on of a crematorium, and the maintenance of &#8220;memorial gardens plots&#8221; in the 
trades to which clauses 146 to 149 apply. 
 
570. Section 91(5) of ICTA provides that a change of ownership is ignored in 
calculating the relief due to the person then carrying on the trade. So subsection (4) of 
this clause includes expenditure incurred by &#8220;a predecessor&#8221; of the company carrying 
on the trade in the definition of ancillary capital expenditure. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="147" SerialNumber="166">Clause 147: Deduction for capital expenditure 
571. This clause provides for a deduction for certain capital expenditure incurred by 
the trader or a predecessor. It is based on section 91 of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 170 of ITTOIA. 
 
572. Section 91 of ICTA refers to &#8220;land&#8221; in a cemetery or crematorium. 
Subsection (1) refers instead to &#8220;an interest in&#8221; such land. This accommodates better 
the possibility that operators of cemeteries and crematoria might sometimes hold land 
in leasehold rather than in freehold form. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="148" SerialNumber="167">Clause 148: Allocation of ancillary capital expenditure 
573. This clause contains special rules for allocating ancillary capital expenditure to 
a period of account. It is based on section 91 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 171 of ITTOIA. 
 
574.   See clause 146(4) for the definition of &#8220;ancillary capital expenditure&#8221;. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="149" SerialNumber="168">Clause 149: Exclusion of expenditure met by subsidies 
575. This clause excludes certain expenditure for the purposes of clause 147. It is 
based on section 91 of ICTA which applies the provisions of section 532 of CAA for 
the purposes of section 91 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 172 of ITTOIA. 
 
576. Subsection (3) refers to a grant made under Northern Ireland legislation and 
declared by the Treasury to correspond to a grant under Part 2 of the Industrial 
Development Act 1982. The term &#8220;Northern Ireland legislation&#8221; is defined by 
Schedule 1 to, and section 24(5) of, the Interpretation Act 1978. 
 
577. The Capital Allowances (Corresponding Northern Ireland Grants) Order 2001 
(SI 2001/810) lists various grants made in Northern Ireland and declared by the 
Treasury to correspond to a grant under Part 2 of the Industrial Development Act 
1982 in so far as they are made towards capital expenditure. The Industrial 
Development Act 1982 has been repealed. But a deduction under clause 147 of this 
Bill continues to be allowed for expenditure met by a grant corresponding to a grant 
under Part 2 of the 1982 Act incurred by the trader, or by a predecessor. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="150" SerialNumber="169">Clause 150: Revenue nature of expenditure 
578. This clause provides for the trader&#8217;s expenditure, on producing or acquiring 
the original master version of a sound recording, to be treated as expenditure of a 
revenue nature. It is based on section 48 of FA 2006. 
 
579. Where this clause applies to a sound recording any of the trader&#8217;s receipts 
from it are treated as having a revenue nature. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="151" SerialNumber="170">Clause 151: Allocation of expenditure 
580. This clause provides for the allocation of a trader&#8217;s expenditure on producing 
or acquiring the original master version of a sound recording except where that master 
version is trading stock. It is based on section 49 of FA 2006. 
 
581. Subsection (3) sets out the basis for the allocation and subsection (4) provides 
for an enhanced allocation in certain cases. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="152" SerialNumber="171">Clause 152: Interpretation of sections 150 and 151 
582. This clause provides definitions of terms used in the previous two clauses. It is 
based on sections 31 and 50 of FA 2006. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="153" SerialNumber="172">Clause 153: Reserves of marketing authorities and certain other statutory bodies 
583. This clause, and the following two clauses, contain special rules for the 
treatment of the statutory reserve funds which must in certain circumstances be 
maintained by certain statutory authorities. It is based on section 509 of ICTA. 
 
584. This clause allows a qualifying statutory body a deduction in calculating its 
trade profits for any amount of its trade surplus that it is required to pay into a reserve 
fund. Any amount withdrawn from the fund is taxed as a trade receipt unless it is a 
repayment of the levy or paid to the producers or a Government Department. 
 
585. Subsections (1) and (2) identify the statutory bodies to which this clause 
applies. 
 
586.   Subsection (5) provides definitions for the purposes of this clause. 
587. The roll of statutes which confer functions that are relevant to these clauses 
and the population of statutory authorities to which these clauses might apply has 
declined in recent years. The Cereals Marketing Act 1965 and the Agriculture Act 
1967 still confer functions that are relevant for the purposes of these clauses. See, in 
particular, the powers to make schemes under section 16 of the 1965 Act and section 
13 of the 1967 Act. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="154" SerialNumber="173">Clause 154: Conditions to be met by reserve fund 
588. This clause contains conditions which must be met by the reserve fund if the 
relief under clause 153 is to be available. It is based on section 509 of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="155" SerialNumber="174">Clause 155: Interpretation of sections 153 and 154 
589. This clause provides definitions of constitutional authorities for the purposes 
of the two previous clauses. It is based on section 509 of ICTA, paragraph 11 of 
Schedule 12 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and section 85 of the Government of 
Wales Act 2006. 
 
590. Subsections (1) and (2) rewrite the source legislation to reflect the effect of 
devolution settlements. See Change 15 in Annex 1. 
 
591. The Government of Wales Act 2006 created a new devolution settlement for 
Wales. It replaced the National Assembly for Wales constituted under the 
Government of Wales Act 1998 (&#8220;the old Assembly&#8221;) with a new National Assembly 
for Wales. Schedule 11 to the 2006 Act provides for functions conferred on the old 
Assembly (with certain exceptions that are not relevant here) to be transferred to the 
Welsh Ministers. It is in theory possible that schemes such as are mentioned in section 
509(1) of ICTA could have been approved by the old Assembly before its functions 
were transferred to the Welsh Ministers. A paragraph in Schedule 2, the Schedule of 
transitionals and savings (reserves of marketing authorities etc), affecting clause 
153(5), covers this possibility. 
 
592. Subsection (1) refers to &#8220;a Minister within the meaning of the Northern Ireland 
Act 1988&#8221;. This rewrites the reference in section 509(3) of ICTA to a &#8220;head of 
department&#8221; read with paragraph 11(1) of Schedule 12 to the Northern Ireland Act 
1998. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="10" SerialNumber="175">Chapter 10: Trade profits: changes in trading stock 
Overview 
593. This Chapter rewrites the rules in Part 2 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008. The rules 
relate to the corporation tax consequences of taking stock from, or introducing stock 
to, a trade. 
 
<Clause Number="156" SerialNumber="176">Clause 156: Meaning of &#8220;trading stock&#8221; 
594. This clause provides a definition for the purposes of this Chapter. It is based 
on paragraph 5 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008. The corresponding income tax rule is in 
section 172A of ITTOIA (inserted by Part 1 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008). 
595. Subsection (2) sets out the main difference between this definition and the one 
used in Chapter 11 of this Part. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="157" SerialNumber="177">Clause 157: Trading stock appropriated by trader 
596. This clause sets out the rule for trading stock taken by a trader. It is based on 
paragraph 6 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008. The corresponding income tax rule is in 
section 172B of ITTOIA (inserted by Part 1 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="158" SerialNumber="178">Clause 158: Trading stock supplied by trader 
597. This clause sets out the rule for something that is supplied by a trader for use 
as trading stock. It is based on paragraph 7 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008. The 
corresponding income tax rule is in section 172C of ITTOIA (inserted by Part 1 of 
Schedule 15 to FA 2008). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="159" SerialNumber="179">Clause 159: Disposals not made in the course of trade 
598. This clause sets out the rule for trading stock disposed of by a trader. It is 
based on paragraph 8 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008. The corresponding income tax rule 
is in section 172D of ITTOIA (inserted by Part 1 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008). 
 
599. The rule in this clause applies to non-trading disposals to a person other than 
the trader. If the stock is taken by the trader clause 157 applies instead. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="160" SerialNumber="180">Clause 160: Acquisitions not made in the course of trade 
600. This clause sets out the rule for trading stock acquired by a trader. It is based 
on paragraph 9 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008. The corresponding income tax rule is in 
section 172E of ITTOIA (inserted by Part 1 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008). 
 
601. The rule in this clause applies to non-trading acquisitions from a person other 
than the trader. If the stock is acquired from the trader clause 158 applies instead. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="161" SerialNumber="181">Clause 161: Transfer pricing rules to take precedence 
602. This clause gives priority to the transfer-pricing rules in Schedule 28AA to 
ICTA. It is based on paragraph 10 of Schedule 15 to FA 2008. The corresponding 
income tax rule is in section 172F of ITTOIA (inserted by Part 1 of Schedule 15 to FA 
2008). 
 
603. The rule in this clause ensures that none of the exemptions in Schedule 28AA 
to ICTA can be overridden by an adjustment imposed by this Chapter of the Bill. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="11" SerialNumber="182">Chapter 11: Trade profits: valuation of stock on cessation of trade 
Overview 
604. This Chapter sets out the rules for valuing stock when a company ceases to 
carry on a trade. The rules for valuing work in progress are not rewritten because, for 
tax purposes, a company cannot carry on a profession (see Change 2 in Annex 1). If a 
company has incomplete services when it ceases to carry on a trade they are included 
in its trading stock (see clause 163(2) of this Bill) and valued in accordance with the 
rules in this Chapter. 
 
<Clause Number="162" SerialNumber="183">Clause 162: Valuation of trading stock on cessation 
605. This clause sets out two general propositions. It is based on section 100 of 
ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 173 of ITTOIA. The first 
proposition is that a valuation has to be made. The second is that the valuation has to 
be made in accordance with the rules in this Chapter. 
 
606. Subsection (3) is the rule for trades carried on in partnership. The general rule 
in ICTA is that a change in the companies carrying on a trade is treated as the 
cessation of the trade. But, in the case of a trade carried on in partnership, section 
114(1) of ICTA provides that there is a cessation for the purpose of calculating the 
profits of the firm&#8217;s trade only if there is a complete change in the companies carrying 
on the trade. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="163" SerialNumber="184">Clause 163: Meaning of &#8220;trading stock&#8221; 
607. This clause defines trading stock. It is based on sections 100 and 101 of ICTA. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 174 of ITTOIA. 
 
608.   The definition of trading stock applies: 
 
    &#8226; in clause 151 (sound recordings); 
 
    &#8226; in this Chapter; 
 
    &#8226; in clause 185 (adjustment on change of basis); and 
 
    &#8226; in clause 195 (post-cessation receipts). 
 
609. Section 101(3) of ICTA is invoked by section 100(2) of that Act and is 
concerned with valuation of incomplete services &#8220;at the discontinuance&#8221;. So the 
definition in this clause refers to incomplete services &#8220;at the time of the cessation&#8221;. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="164" SerialNumber="185">Clause 164: Basis of valuation of trading stock 
610. This clause introduces the five clauses that follow. It is based on section 100 
of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 175 of ITTOIA. 
 
611. The five clauses (including clause 168 which defines &#8220;connected persons&#8221;) 
deal with the valuation of stock that is transferred to another trader. In each case, the 
requirement in section 100 of ICTA that the transferee carries on a trade is relaxed to 
include transfers to a person carrying on a profession or vocation. The income tax 
rules are amended to bring the income tax and corporation tax codes into line. See 
Change 39 in Annex 1. 
612. Subsection (4) of this clause deals with the case where the stock is not 
transferred to a person carrying on a trade, profession or vocation. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="165" SerialNumber="186">Clause 165: Sale basis of valuation: sale to unconnected person 
613. This clause sets out the rule for the common case where the trading stock is 
transferred to an unconnected trader. It is based on section 100 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 176 of ITTOIA. 
 
614. The clause leads directly to the use of the sale price of the stock as the basis of 
valuation. If the transfer is other than by sale, clause 170 explains how the expressions 
used in this clause are to be interpreted. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="166" SerialNumber="187">Clause 166: Sale basis of valuation: sale to connected person 
615. This clause sets out the rule for the case where the stock is transferred to a 
connected person. It is based on section 100 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 177 of ITTOIA. 
 
616. The clause preserves the concept of an arm&#8217;s length price. This will usually be 
the same as the open market value (see clause 164(4)) but sometimes there will be a 
difference. 
 
617. For example, in a capital transfer tax case, IRC v Spencer-Nairn [1991] STC 
60, the Court of Session considered the meaning of an arm&#8217;s length price and 
distinguished it from open market value. This was on the basis that the seller in that 
case had imperfect information. A sale at arm&#8217;s length by that seller would not assume 
that the seller had better information; a sale in the open market would assume perfect 
information on both sides of the bargain. 
 
618. Furthermore, in the case of an actual sale to a connected trader, there is no 
need to assume there is a sale. It is enough to treat the sale as made at arm&#8217;s length. 
This leaves open the possibility that the stock is worth something different from open 
market value to a person who intends to use the stock in the trade. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="167" SerialNumber="188">Clause 167: Sale basis of valuation: election by connected persons 
619. This clause allows the seller and purchaser of stock that would otherwise be 
valued at arm&#8217;s length under clause 166 to elect to use instead the price paid for the 
stock. It is based on section 100 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 178 of ITTOIA. 
 
620. The election cannot be made unless the arm&#8217;s length value of the stock is 
greater than its &#8220;acquisition value&#8221; in the hands of the seller. 
 
621. The &#8220;acquisition value&#8221; of the stock for the company which ceases to trade is 
effectively book value, but the definition in subsection (5) is more complicated than 
this. In the case where the net realisable value of stock has fallen below cost in the 
period leading up to cessation, a new period is deemed to start just before the deemed 
sale. That allows the new, lower, net realisable value to be used. It may be possible to 
manipulate net realisable value by selling the stock at an undervalue after the 
accounting date. So paragraph (a) of the definition assumes that the sale is at an arm&#8217;s 
length value. 
 
622. The election substitutes the price paid for the arm&#8217;s length value of the stock. 
But the price paid must be higher than the acquisition value. Otherwise, the election 
substitutes the acquisition value for the arm&#8217;s length value. 
 
623. This clause does not specify that the election is to be made to &#8220;the inspector&#8221;. 
But the general rules about claims and elections in Schedule 18 to FA 1998 require 
elections to be made in a return or, if that is not possible, to &#8220;an officer of Revenue 
and Customs&#8221; in accordance with Schedule 1A to TMA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="168" SerialNumber="189">Clause 168: Connected persons 
624. This clause provides a definition of connected persons for the stock valuation 
clauses. It is based on section 100 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is 
in section 179 of ITTOIA. 
 
625. This clause is one of the exceptions to the general rule in clause 1258 that a 
firm is not to be regarded for tax purposes as a separate entity. If a firm is connected 
with the seller or purchaser of its stock, clause 166 (rather than clause 165) applies but 
the firm may make an election under clause 167. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="169" SerialNumber="190">Clause 169: Cost to buyer of stock valued on sale basis of valuation 
626. This clause sets out the rule for the buyer of the stock. It is based on section 
100 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 180 of ITTOIA. 
 
627. In a &#8220;sale basis&#8221; case, the value given to the trading stock of the company 
whose trade has ceased is also used to calculate the profits of the buyer of the stock. 
 
628. The reference to ITTOIA caters for the case where the stock is acquired from a 
person liable to income tax. The valuation under that Act for income tax purposes is 
used as the cost to the buyer who is liable to corporation tax. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="170" SerialNumber="191">Clause 170: Meaning of &#8220;sale&#8221; and related expressions 
629. The stock valuation clauses refer to a sale of stock. This clause explains how 
the clauses are to be interpreted if the stock is transferred other than by way of sale. It 
is based on section 100 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 181 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="171" SerialNumber="192">Clause 171: Determination of questions 
630. This clause treats any &#8220;question&#8221; arising under clauses 164 to 167 as an appeal 
(to be determined by the tribunal). It is based on section 102 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 186 of ITTOIA. 

 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="12" SerialNumber="193">Chapter 12: Deductions from profits: unremittable amounts 
Overview 
631. This Chapter gives statutory effect to ESC C34. The corresponding rules for 
income tax are in Chapter 13 of Part 2 of ITTOIA. See part (A) of Change 40 in 
Annex 1. This change reproduces Change 50 in ITTOIA and so brings the income tax 
and corporation tax codes back into line. 
 
632. The extra-statutory concession provides relief for trade debts that cannot be 
remitted to the United Kingdom. It is similar in scope to section 584 of ICTA (relief 
for unremittable overseas income), which is rewritten as Part 18 of this Bill 
(unremittable income). The corresponding provision for income tax is Chapter 4 of 
Part 8 of ITTOIA. 
 
633. Section 584 of ICTA provides relief for unremittable income arising outside 
the United Kingdom, including unremittable trade profits. But relief under section 584 
of ICTA does not extend to trade debts owed to, or paid to, the company outside the 
United Kingdom if the profits of the trade arise in the United Kingdom. This Chapter 
provides relief for such debts and payments. 
 
634. ESC C34 requires the relief to be claimed. Under this Chapter the relief is 
allowed as a deduction without the need for a formal claim. See part (B) of Change 40 
in Annex 1. 
 
635. The deduction is not mandatory if the qualifying conditions are met. A 
company can choose whether or not to include the deduction in its tax return. If a 
deduction is taken the recovery provisions in clause 175 follow automatically. 
 
<Clause Number="172" SerialNumber="194">Clause 172: Application of Chapter 
636. This clause defines the basic concepts. It is based on ESC C34. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 188 of ITTOIA. 
 
637. The relief applies both to amounts owed to the company and to amounts that 
have been paid to the company. Relief is allowed if some, or all, of those amounts 
cannot be remitted to the United Kingdom because of foreign exchange restrictions. 
The different definitions of &#8220;unremittable&#8221; in subsections (2) and (3) reflect the 
differences between an amount that has been paid and an amount owed. 
 
638. The relief is available to any company, including a company carrying on a 
financial trade. 
 
639. Subsection (4) provides a definition of &#8220;foreign exchange restrictions&#8221;. Local 
foreign exchange restrictions are not defined in the extra-statutory concession but are 
clearly a key concept in the operation of the concession. This subsection introduces a 
definition based on section 584(1)(a) of ICTA. That subsection is rewritten as clause 
1274 (unremittable income: introduction) in Part 18. The corresponding provision for 
income tax is section 841(3) of ITTOIA. By basing the definition on section 584 of 
ICTA this Bill brings the two reliefs into line. 
 
640. This clause and the rewrite of section 584 of ICTA in Part 18 of this Bill 
clarify the scope of section 584 of ICTA and the extra-statutory concession in two 
ways. 
 
641. First, sections 584(1)(a) of ICTA refers to &#8220;the impossibility of obtaining 
foreign currency in that territory&#8221;. It could be argued that this condition is not met if it 
is possible to obtain foreign currency in the overseas territory regardless of whether 
that currency may be transferred to the United Kingdom. Clause 1274 of Part 18 of 
this Bill makes clear that it must not be possible to obtain foreign currency that could 
be transferred to the United Kingdom. 
 
642. Second, clause 1274 of Part 18 of this Bill makes clear that the reference to 
foreign currency in section 584(1)(a) of ICTA does not include currency of the 
overseas country or territory. In relation to sterling the currency of the overseas 
country or territory clearly is foreign but in this context &#8220;foreign&#8221; means foreign to the 
local territory. 
 
643. Subsection (5) deals with the interaction with the loan relationship rules. Most 
of the amounts in this Chapter will be within the scope of Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 
1996 because they are loan relationships (rewritten in Parts 5 and 6 of this Bill). In 
particular section 100 of FA 1996 treats trade debts as loan relationships (see Chapter 
2 of Part 6). 
 
644. Section 80(5) of FA 1996 is a wide-ranging rule which provides that only 
Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 1996 applies to any loan relationship unless there is an 
express provision to the contrary. Section 80(5) of FA 1996 has been rewritten as 
clause 464(1). This rule would prevent relief being given under clause 173 or 
recovered under clause 175. Subsection (5) overrides clause 464(1). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="173" SerialNumber="195">Clause 173: Relief for unremittable amounts 
645. This clause sets out how the relief is given. It is based on ESC C34. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 189 of ITTOIA. 
 
646. The clause has more detail than the extra-statutory concession about the 
mechanics of the relief. This is necessary to give the certainty required for corporation 
tax self assessment. Relief can be given only against the profits of the trade that 
include the unremittable amount. It cannot be used to create or increase a loss. But 
any excess relief is not lost. It is carried forward and set against future profits of the 
trade. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="174" SerialNumber="196">Clause 174: Restrictions on relief 
647. This clause describes the various circumstances in which relief is not allowed. 
It is based on ESC C34. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 190 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
648. Subsection (1) denies a deduction if the funds are applied outside the United 
Kingdom. 
 
649. Subsection (2) denies a deduction if the company has received an insurance 
recovery in respect of the debt. This differs from the approach in the extra-statutory 
concession. Paragraph 4 of the concession denies relief if any part of the debt is 
insured. This Bill denies, or recovers, relief only if an insurance recovery is received. 
See part (C) of Change 40 in Annex 1. 
 
650. Subsection (3) denies a deduction if the company can make a claim under 
clause 1275 (claim for relief for unremittable income) in Part 18 that the income is 
unremittable. The corresponding provision for income tax is section 842 of ITTOIA. 
 
651. This restriction will apply only if the profits of the trade that include the 
unremittable amounts arise outside the United Kingdom, for example, because the 
profits arise in an overseas branch. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="175" SerialNumber="197">Clause 175: Withdrawal of relief 
652. This clause sets out the circumstances in which relief is withdrawn and the 
machinery by which it is withdrawn. It is based on ESC C34. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 191 of ITTOIA. 
 
653. Subsection (2) lists the events that trigger a withdrawal of the relief. 
Paragraphs (a) and (e) deal with the straightforward cases in which the amount, or part 
of it, ceases to be unremittable or is exchanged for an amount that can be remitted. 
Paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) deal with the events listed in clause 174 that would have 
prevented relief being given if they had occurred before the deduction was allowed. 
 
654. Paragraph (f) deals with the case of insurance recoveries. It differs from the 
approach in the extra-statutory concession, which denies any relief if the debt is 
insured. This Chapter denies or recovers relief only if an insurance recovery is 
received (see the commentary on clause 174). See part (C) of Change 40 in Annex 1. 
 
655. This follows the approach in section 584 of ICTA when a payment is received 
from the Exports Credit Guarantee Department. The withdrawal of relief under 
section 584 of ICTA is rewritten as clause 1276 (unremittable income: withdrawal of 
relief) in Part 18. The corresponding provision for income tax is section 843 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
656. Subsection (3) sets out the way the relief is recovered. The amount identified 
in subsection (2) is treated as a trade receipt for the accounting period in which the 
event occurs. It is possible that more than one event will apply to the same amount. 
Subsection (3)(b) ensures the relief is withdrawn only once. 
 
657. Subsection (4) applies if the amount of the insurance recovery is less than the 
amount that is unremittable. In that case the amount of the recovery is limited to the 
amount of the insurance recovery. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="13" SerialNumber="198">Chapter 13: Disposal and acquisition of know-how 
Overview 
658. This Chapter sets out the rules for calculating trade profits if a trading 
company receives a payment for know-how. Payments to non-traders are dealt with 
by the rules in Chapter 2 of Part 9 of this Bill. 
 
659. Part 8 of this Bill sets out rules for the taxation of gains and losses on 
companies&#8217; intangible fixed assets. Those rules take priority over any other tax rules 
(see clause 906). So the Part 8 rules generally apply instead of the rules in this 
Chapter. But Chapter 16 of Part 8 ensures that the new rules apply only to assets 
created or acquired on or after 1 April 2002. 
 
660. The Chapter refers to the &#8220;disposal&#8221; of know-how. As Walton J pointed out in 
John and E Sturges Ltd v Hessel (1975), 51 TC 183 ChD 6 (on page 206): 
 
       the mere imparting of &#8220;know-how&#8221; cannot be equated with the disposal of a capital asset. Just like the 
       schoolmaster&#8217;s knowledge, it remains the property of the person imparting it as well after as before 
       another is told. 
 
661. This Bill retains &#8220;disposal&#8221; because &#8220;disclosure&#8221; gives rise to difficulties in 
identifying the person to whom the disclosure is made (who may not be the person 
who buys the know-how). 
 
<Clause Number="176" SerialNumber="199">Clause 176: Meaning of &#8220;know-how&#8221; etc 
662. This clause sets out the meaning of know-how and explains other concepts 
used in the Chapter. It is based on sections 531 and 533 of ICTA and section 572 of 
CAA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 192 of ITTOIA. 
 
663. The definition of &#8220;mineral deposits&#8221; in subsection (2) is restored to what it was 
before the enactment of CAA. See Change 41 in Annex 1. 
 
664. Subsections (5) and (6) extend the meaning of &#8220;sale&#8221; to include an exchange. 
This rule is based on section 572 of CAA, which applies to section 531 of ICTA in 
accordance with section 532 of ICTA. 
 
    [1975] STC 127 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="177" SerialNumber="200">Clause 177: Disposal of know-how if trade continues to be carried on 
665. This clause sets out a general rule for the treatment of payments received for 
the disposal of know-how. It is based on section 531 of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 193 of ITTOIA. 
 
666. Subsections (3) to (6) deal with the case where know-how is disposed of with 
other assets. The rules are based on sections 562 and 563 of CAA, which apply to 
section 531 of ICTA in accordance with section 532 of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="178" SerialNumber="201">Clause 178: Disposal of know-how as part of disposal of all or part of a trade 
667. This clause sets out the main exception to the general rule in clause 177. It is 
based on section 531 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 
194 of ITTOIA. 
 
668. Subsection (2) provides that a payment for know-how as part of the disposal of 
a trade is generally treated as a capital receipt for goodwill. This rule applies only if 
the person making the disposal is liable to corporation tax. If that person is liable to 
income tax the rule in section 194 of ITTOIA applies, with the same result. 
 
669. Subsection (5) allows the parties to the transaction to elect for the payment not 
to be treated as one for goodwill. The effect of an election for the purchaser is that the 
payment may qualify for capital allowances under Part 7 of CAA. Or, exceptionally, 
the purchaser may be able to treat the payment as a trading expense. As such an 
election may affect both parties to the transaction the election has to be made by both. 
 
670. The question whether the election is made under this clause or under 
section 194(5) of ITTOIA is decided by reference to the position of the person 
disposing of the know-how. If that person is liable to corporation tax this clause 
applies; if the person is liable to income tax, ITTOIA applies. 
 
671. This clause does not specify that the election is to be made to &#8220;the inspector&#8221;. 
But the general rules about claims and elections in Schedule 18 to FA 1998 require 
elections to be made in a return or, if that is not possible, to &#8220;an officer of Revenue 
and Customs&#8221; in accordance with Schedule 1A to TMA. 
 
672. Subsection (6) gives the time limit for the election. Most elections in this Bill 
have to be made &#8220;not later than two years after the end of the accounting period &#8230;&#8221;. 
But in this case one of the persons making the election may be chargeable to income 
tax. So the time limit for an election is based on the date of the disposal. 
 
673. Subsection (7) deals with a disposal by an income tax payer to a corporation 
tax payer. An election under section 194(5) of ITTOIA is treated as an election under 
this clause. The corresponding rule for a disposal by a corporation payer to an income 
tax payer is in section 194(7) of ITTOIA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="179" SerialNumber="202">Clause 179: Seller controlled by buyer etc 
674. This clause ensures that if the seller and buyer are under common control: 
 
    &#8226; the general rule in clause 177 does not apply; and 
 
    &#8226; the parties to the transaction may not elect for the payment for know-how not 
       to be treated as a capital payment for goodwill. 
 
675. The clause is based on section 531 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 195 of ITTOIA. 
 
676. For the purposes of this clause, &#8220;control&#8221; is defined in section 840 of ICTA (as 
applied by clause 1316 of this Bill). The ICTA definition of &#8220;control&#8221; is identical in 
effect to that in section 574 of CAA. But, as the relevance of &#8220;control&#8221; in this Bill 
goes wider than this Chapter, the ICTA definition is used here. 
 
677. This clause is one of the exceptions to the general rule in clause 1258 of this 
Bill that a firm is not to be regarded for tax purposes as a separate entity. If a firm is 
connected with the seller or purchaser of its know-how the payment for know-how is 
treated as one for goodwill. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="14" SerialNumber="203">Chapter 14: Adjustment on change of basis 
Overview 
678. This Chapter sets out the rules for dealing with two sorts of changes in the way 
profits of a trade are calculated. 
 
679. The first sort of change is in the way the accounts are drawn up. The rule is 
that profits must be calculated on the basis of accounts drawn up in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting practice (see section 50 of FA 2004 and clause 46 of 
this Bill). 
 
680. If there is a change in the basis on which accounts are drawn up, some receipts 
and expenses may fall out of account for tax purposes. This sort of change was dealt 
with originally in the rules that became section 104(4) to (7) of ICTA. Those rules 
were replaced by the rules in section 44 of, and Schedule 6 to, FA 1998. The 1998 
rules were replaced by section 64 of, and Schedule 22 to, FA 2002. 
 
681. The second sort of change is in the way tax adjustments are made. These are 
the adjustments &#8220;required or authorised by law in calculating profits for tax purposes&#8221; 
(clause 46). This sort of change was dealt with for the first time by the 2002 
legislation. 
 
682.   Clause 1267 of this Bill applies the rules to trades carried on in partnership. 
 
683. The corresponding rules for income tax are in Chapter 17 of Part 2 of ITTOIA. 
The title of that Chapter is &#8220;adjustment income&#8221; because there is a charge on such 
income in section 228(2) of ITTOIA. For corporation tax a positive adjustment is 
treated as a trade receipt. So the title of this Chapter is more general. 
 
<Clause Number="180" SerialNumber="204">Clause 180: Application of Chapter 
684. This clause sets out the circumstances in which an adjustment may arise. It is 
based on section 64 of FA 2002. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 
227 of ITTOIA. 
 
685. Section 64 of FA 2002 refers to a change of the basis on which profits are 
calculated. This might mean any change of basis. But paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 22 
to FA 2002 makes clear that it does not include a change which occurs on a change of 
ownership of a trade. 
 
686. The trading income rules in this Part are generally &#8220;company-based&#8221;. So this 
clause applies when a company changes the basis. That company must be the same 
before and after the change of basis. So this clause reproduces the effect of paragraph 
3(2) of Schedule 22 to FA 2002. 
 
687.   An adjustment has to be made if: 
 
    &#8226; the &#8220;old basis&#8221; accorded with the law or practice at the time; and 
 
    &#8226; the &#8220;new basis&#8221; accords with the current law and practice. 
 
688. The difference in wording is to cater for a case in which a decision of the 
Courts makes it clear that a previously accepted view of the law was wrong. In that 
case, the old basis accorded with the practice but not the law. The 1998 rules did not 
cater for this. But the 2002 rules (and the rules in this Chapter) do. 
 
689. The clause refers to &#8220;a trade&#8221;. So the rules apply to trades carried on wholly 
outside the United Kingdom as they apply to trades carried on at least partly in the 
United Kingdom. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="181" SerialNumber="205">Clause 181: Giving effect to positive and negative adjustments 
690. This clause sets out the treatment of the adjustment. It is based on paragraphs 
4 and 5 of Schedule 22 to FA 2002. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 228 of ITTOIA. 
 
691. If the adjustment is positive it is treated as a trade receipt; if the adjustment is 
negative it is treated as a trade expense. 
 
692. In both cases the treatment is the same whether the trade is taxable under Case 
I or Case V of Schedule D in the source legislation. The adjustment is treated as 
arising on the first day of the first period of account for which the new basis is 
adopted. This contrasts with the income tax treatment which is that the adjustment 
arises on the last day of the period (see sections 232 and 233 of ITTOIA). 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="182" SerialNumber="206">Clause 182: Calculation of the adjustment 
693. This clause contains the main rules for calculating the adjustment. It is based 
on paragraph 2 of Schedule 22 to FA 2002. The corresponding rule for income tax is 
in section 231 of ITTOIA. The clause presents the rules as a method statement. 
 
694. In item 3 of each of Step 1 and Step 2 there is a reference to work in progress 
as an alternative to trading stock. This follows the source legislation and is needed 
because the extended meaning of &#8220;trading stock&#8221; in clause 163 of this Bill does not 
apply outside Chapter 11. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="183" SerialNumber="207">Clause 183: No adjustment for certain expenses previously brought into account 
695. This clause deals with the case where the old basis of calculation allowed a tax 
deduction but the new basis requires the deduction to be spread over several periods. 
It is based on paragraph 6 of Schedule 22 to FA 2002. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 234 of ITTOIA. 
 
696. In the absence of this clause there would be a positive adjustment within item 
2 of Step 1 of the calculation of the adjustment in clause 182. That would produce the 
right result overall but the rule would take effect too early. Instead, no adjustment is 
calculated but no deduction is allowed in future for expenses that have already been 
taken into account. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="184" SerialNumber="208">Clause 184: Cases where adjustment not required until assets realised or written 
off 
697. This clause is a timing rule for an adjustment which results from any of the 
amounts in subsection (2). It is based on paragraph 7 of Schedule 22 to FA 2002. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 235 of ITTOIA. 
 
698.   The amounts in subsection (2) are: 
 
    &#8226; closing trading stock; 
 
    &#8226; opening trading stock; and 
 
    &#8226; depreciation. 
 
699. The general timing rule is that any adjustment is made at the start of the first 
period of account on the new basis (see clause 181(2) and (3)). But any adjustment for 
stock or depreciation is made when the asset is realised or written off. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="185" SerialNumber="209">Clause 185: Change from realisation basis to mark to market 
700. This clause is concerned with a change from the realisation basis to &#8220;mark to 
market&#8221; accounting. It is based on paragraph 8 of Schedule 22 to FA 2002. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 236 of ITTOIA. 
701. &#8220;Mark to market&#8221; is a basis of accounting used by traders in financial assets. 
Instead of carrying the assets in the books at cost, financial traders draw up accounts 
to show the assets at fair value at the accounting date. But for tax purposes the 
realisation basis may have been used. 
 
702. In the first period in which mark to market is adopted for tax purposes, the 
opening stock may be valued at a higher (market) value than the closing stock of the 
previous period. Or a financial asset may have been carried in the accounts at cost but 
appear as a deduction in a later period at fair value. In either case, there is an 
adjustment within clause 182. 
 
703.   As in clause 184, the adjustment is postponed until the asset is realised. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="186" SerialNumber="210">Clause 186: Election for spreading if section 185 applies 
704. This clause provides for an election to be made if there is a receipt (following 
a change to mark to market) under clause 185. It is based on paragraph 9 of Schedule 
22 to FA 2002. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 237 of ITTOIA. 
 
705. The election is to spread the adjustment receipt over six periods of account 
beginning with the first one in which the new basis is adopted. As the receipt is 
postponed under clause 185 until the asset is realised, this first period is not 
necessarily the one in which the charge would be made without the election. 
 
706.   &#8220;Period of account&#8221; is defined in section 832(1) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="187" SerialNumber="211">Clause 187: Transfer of insurance business 
707. This clause further postpones the charge on an adjustment in the case of assets 
to which clause 185 or 186 applies. It is based on paragraph 10 of Schedule 22 to FA 
2002. It is the only clause in this Chapter that has no corresponding section in Chapter 
17 of Part 2 of ITTOIA. 
 
708. The clause applies only to insurance companies. If the asset of an insurance 
company is transferred to another insurance company in accordance with a relevant 
transfer scheme, it is not treated as &#8220;realised&#8221; for the purpose of clauses 185 and 186 
until it is realised by the transferee company. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="15" SerialNumber="212">Chapter 15: Post-cessation receipts 
Overview 
709. This Chapter charges receipts which are derived from a trade but are not 
received until after the trade has ceased and have not been brought into the calculation 
of profits. 
 
710. The Chapter rewrites sections 103 and 104 of ICTA without distinguishing 
between trade profits calculated on an earnings basis and trade profits calculated on a 
&#8220;conventional basis&#8221; (see section 110(4) of ICTA). One consequence of this approach 
is that there is no need to rewrite section 104(3) or section 110(3) to (5) of ICTA. 

 
<Clause Number="188" SerialNumber="213">Clause 188: Charge to tax on post-cessation receipts 
711. This clause applies the corporation tax charge on income to post-cessation 
receipts. It is based on sections 103 and 104 of ICTA. This application of the charge is 
separate from that on the profits of a trade (see clause 35 of this Bill). The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 242 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="189" SerialNumber="214">Clause 189: Extent of charge to tax 
712. This clause sets out the charge to tax. It is based on sections 103 and 104 of 
ICTA, which create a charge under Schedule D Case VI on post-cessation receipts. 
This Bill deals with the income where it logically belongs. In this case the income is 
trading income. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 243 of ITTOIA. 
 
713. The charge in the source legislation under Schedule D Case VI has 
consequences for loss relief. This Bill preserves the position for loss relief by 
amending section 396 of ICTA and listing this Chapter in section 834A of ICTA (see 
Schedule 1 to this Bill). 
 
714. Subsection (3) deals with a company which has become non-UK resident after 
the trade has ceased. A trade carried on at least partly in the United Kingdom may 
include income that arises abroad. When the company was resident in the United 
Kingdom all the profits of the trade would have been within the charge under Part 2 of 
this Bill (see clause 5). This subsection removes the charge on a non-UK resident 
company if the receipt arises abroad. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="190" SerialNumber="215">Clause 190: Basic meaning of &#8220;post-cessation receipt&#8221; 
715. This clause sets out the basic meaning of &#8220;post-cessation receipt&#8221;. It is based 
on sections 103, 104 and 110 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 246 of ITTOIA. 
 
716. Subsection (2) deals with the unusual case of a company receiving a &#8220;sum&#8221; 
which arises from the carrying on of a trade by a person liable to income tax. 
 
717. Paragraph (a) deals with a non-UK resident company liable to income tax. If a 
company becomes liable to corporation tax it is treated as ceasing to carry on the 
income tax trade. A post-cessation receipt from that trade may be charged to 
corporation tax. 
 
718. Paragraph (b) applies where the trade was carried on in partnership. If a 
partner leaves a firm and a company receives a sum arising from the carrying on of 
the trade by that partner, the sum may be a post-cessation receipt. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="191" SerialNumber="216">Clause 191: Other rules about what counts as post-cessation receipts 
719. This clause is new. It contains signposts to: 
 
    &#8226; the seven clauses in this Bill that treat other sums as post-cessation receipts; 
       and 
    &#8226; the two clauses in this Bill that exclude certain sums from the charge on post- 
       cessation receipts. 
 
720.   The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 247 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="192" SerialNumber="217">Clause 192: Debts paid after cessation 
721. This clause sets out what happens when a trader is allowed a deduction for a 
bad or doubtful debt owed to the trade but then recovers the debt after the trade has 
ceased. It is based on section 103 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is 
in section 248 of ITTOIA. 
 
722. If a deduction for the debt has been given during the course of the trade 
section 103(5) of ICTA makes it clear that the recovery has not been &#8220;brought into 
account&#8221; in calculating the trade profits. The result is that the recovery is within the 
charge in section 103 of ICTA. 
 
723. Subsections (1) and (2) treat the recovery of the debt as a post-cessation 
receipt. The references to section 35 of ITTOIA and income tax cater for the 
possibility that a deduction for a bad debt is allowed to a person liable to income tax 
but the debt is paid to a person liable to corporation tax. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="193" SerialNumber="218">Clause 193: Debts released after cessation 
724. This clause sets out the rules that apply when a debt owed by the trader is 
released after the trade has ceased. It is based on section 103 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 249 of ITTOIA. 
 
725. Subsection (1) sets out the four conditions to be met if the clause is to apply. It 
is the equivalent of clause 94 of this Bill which applies in the case of a continuing 
trade. The reference to income tax caters for the possibility that a deduction for an 
expense is allowed to a person liable to income tax but a person liable to corporation 
tax takes over the related trade debt and is released from it. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="194" SerialNumber="219">Clause 194: Transfer of rights if transferee does not carry on trade 
726. This clause deals with the position of the transferor if the right to a post- 
cessation receipt is transferred for value to a non-trading transferee. It is based on 
section 106 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 251 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
727. The transferor is charged to tax on the amount received for the transfer if the 
transfer is at arm&#8217;s length. Otherwise the transferor is charged to tax on the arm&#8217;s 
length value of the transfer. There is no later charge to tax on the transferee when the 
post-cessation receipt is received. 
 
728. Clause 95 of this Bill sets out the position if the transfer is to a trading 
transferee. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="195" SerialNumber="220">Clause 195: Transfer of trading stock 
729. This clause excludes from the charge on post-cessation receipts sums arising 
from the transfer of stock. It is based on sections 103, 104 and 110 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 252 of ITTOIA. 
 
730. Subsection (1) makes explicit the general rule that there is no tax charge on a 
post-cessation receipt arising from trading stock. 
 
731. The policy is that stock should be valued at cessation in accordance with the 
rules in Chapter 11 of this Part. Once that has been done there is no need to charge tax 
on any sums arising from the disposal or realisation of stock. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="196" SerialNumber="221">Clause 196: Allowable deductions 
732. This clause is the first of two that set out the rules for allowing deductions 
from sums charged as post-cessation receipts. It is based on section 105 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 254 of ITTOIA. 
 
733. Subsection (3) ensures that a deduction is not allowed for any expenses for 
which relief has already been allowed (for income tax) under section 96 of ITA or 
under any other provision. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="197" SerialNumber="222">Clause 197: Further rules about allowable deductions 
734. This clause is the second of two that set out the rules for allowing deductions 
from sums charged as post-cessation receipts. It is based on section 105 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 255 of ITTOIA. 
 
735. Subsection (2) ensures that any loss unused at the date of cessation is set off 
against post-cessation receipts in the same order as it would have been set off against 
profits under section 393 of ICTA, that is, against an earlier accounting period before 
a later accounting period. 
 
736. The references to capital allowances in section 105(1)(b) and (3) of ICTA are 
no longer needed because any capital allowance is allowed as a trading expense. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="198" SerialNumber="223">Clause 198: Election to carry back 
737. This clause allows a company to elect to have a post-cessation receipt taxed as 
though it had been received in the accounting period in which the company ceased to 
carry on the trade. It is based on section 108 of ICTA, although that section was 
repealed by ITTOIA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 257 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
738.   See Change 42 in Annex 1. 
 
739. Subsection (1) requires that the post-cessation receipt is received (broadly) 
within six years after the company ceases to carry on the trade. This corresponds to 
the limit in section 108 of ICTA (which was expressed in terms of years of 
assessment). 
 
740. Subsection (3) gives a two year time limit for the election. This was the 
original time limit in section 108 of ICTA before it was amended for (income tax) 
Self Assessment. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="199" SerialNumber="224">Clause 199: Deductions already made are not displaced 
741. This clause is a rule about losses allowed against a post-cessation receipts 
carried back to the period of cessation under clause 198. It is new. 
 
742. The rule in this clause is broadly the same as the income tax rule in paragraph 
5(5) of Schedule 1B to TMA. If relief has already been given under clause 196, for a 
period later than the period of cessation, this clause makes clear that the relief is not to 
be re-calculated as a result of the election under clause 198. 
 
743. The clause refers only to a &#8220;loss&#8221; for which a deduction has already been 
made. Any &#8220;expense or debit&#8221; already allowed under clause 196 would in any event 
not be available for the accounting period in which the cessation occurred. 
 
744. Subsection (3) makes clear that the rule about &#8220;displacing&#8221; a deduction for a 
loss does not apply to a deduction that has been made from the post-cessation receipt 
that is to be carried back. 
 
745.   See Change 42 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="200" SerialNumber="225">Clause 200: Election given effect in accounting period in which receipt is 
received 
746. This clause sets out the procedure for dealing with an election under clause 
198. It is new. 
 
747. The procedure for giving the relief is broadly the same as that for income tax. 
This is an election to which paragraph 58 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 applies. This 
clause makes clear that the relief is in terms of tax and corresponds to the income tax 
rule in paragraph 5 of Schedule 1B to TMA.

<Clause Number="201" SerialNumber="227">Clause 201: Provisions which must be given priority over this Part 
749. This clause sets out the priority rules that apply when a receipt or other credit 
item might otherwise fall within more than one head of charge. It is based on 
section 18 of ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 4 of 
ITTOIA. 
750. Subsection (2) deals with potential overlap with ITEPA. It is based on section 
18 of ICTA. In the source legislation Schedule D is the residual Schedule. So the 
charge in ITEPA on employment income, and other income formerly within Schedule 
E, has priority over the charge on profits of a trade (Schedule D in the source 
legislation). 
 
</Clause></Chapter></Part><Part Number="4" SerialNumber="228">Part 4: Property income 
Overview 
751. This Part applies to &#8220;property income&#8221;. That is, income from land. The 
corresponding rules for income tax are in Part 3 of ITTOIA. 
 
752. This Part covers income that is taxed under different Schedules and Cases in 
the source legislation. So it covers, for example, income from land both in the United 
Kingdom and abroad, as well as post-cessation receipts from property businesses. 
 
753. This reflects the approach of grouping types of income which are logically 
part of the same &#8220;family&#8221;. In this Part the unifying factor is that all the elements are 
amounts that are, ultimately, attributable to exploiting an interest in land. 
 
754. As a consequence, this Part groups elements which in the source legislation 
are separate. But those elements do not lose their identity for all purposes. Loss relief, 
for example, requires them to be kept apart. For this reason the charge to corporation 
tax on &#8220;property income&#8221; has specific components (see clause 202). 
 
755. This Part is not an exhaustive statement of the rules for the calculation of 
property income. Other regimes may affect that calculation. In particular, Parts 8, 11 
and 14 of this Bill contain rules that may affect property business profits. 
 
756. References to &#8220;profits or gains&#8221; in the source legislation which relate only to 
income are rewritten in this Part omitting the reference to &#8220;gains&#8221;. This continues the 
tidying up of such references begun in section 46(3) of, and Schedule 7 to, FA 1998.

758. This clause introduces the Chapter and provides a &#8220;road map&#8221; to the key 
provisions. It is new. 
 
759. Chapter 2 sets out the key concepts underlying the main component of income 
within this Part of this Bill by defining &#8220;property business&#8221; and &#8220;generating income 
from land&#8221;. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="204" SerialNumber="233">Clause 204: Meaning of &#8220;property business&#8221; 
760. This clause defines &#8220;property business&#8221;. It is new. 
 
761. Subsection (1) reflects the fact that section 70A of ICTA applies the same 
basic rules for income from UK land to income from overseas land. So most of the 
provisions in this Part apply to both UK and overseas property businesses alike. 
Where they do not, the particular clause makes that clear by, for example, referring to 
a UK property business only. 
 
762. The term &#8220;property business&#8221; is not entirely straightforward. The term used in 
the source legislation, &#8220;Schedule A business&#8221;, was introduced as part of the 1995 
reform of Schedule A for income tax and was applied to corporation tax in 1998. That 
concept was helpful in providing a vessel to contain all the income from land 
previously charged under Schedule A and to which the rules for calculating trade 
profits could be applied. But the concept of a Schedule A business, and a UK property 
business, is rather more complex than that of a trade. That is reflected in this and the 
other clauses that, together, define the range of income that is assessed as income of a 
property business. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="205" SerialNumber="234">Clause 205: UK property business 
763. This clause defines &#8220;UK property business&#8221; and introduces the concept of 
&#8220;generating income from land&#8221;. It is based on section 15(1) of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 264 of ITTOIA. 
 
764. It gives a basic &#8220;one business per company&#8221; rule: that (subject to special cases 
such as those mentioned in clause 203(3) and (4)) all the income from a company&#8217;s 
UK land interests is treated as falling within a single UK property business. 
 
765. Although the Chapter builds on the concept of the &#8220;business&#8221;, the approach 
differs from the approach in the source legislation. This Bill adopts the same approach 
as ITTOIA and uses the term &#8220;UK property business&#8221; rather than &#8220;Schedule A 
business&#8221;. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="206" SerialNumber="235">Clause 206: Overseas property business 
766. This clause defines &#8220;overseas property business&#8221;. It is based on section 70A of 
ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 265 of ITTOIA. 
 
767. The definition is identical to that of &#8220;UK property business&#8221; except that the 
land from which the income arises is outside the United Kingdom. 
 
768. For the purpose of deciding whether there is an overseas property business, 
overseas land law is interpreted in accordance with clause 290. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="207" SerialNumber="236">Clause 207: Meaning of &#8220;generating income from land&#8221; 
769. This clause defines &#8220;generating income from land&#8221;. It is based on sections 
15(1) and 24 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 266 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
770. The clause defines what may be described as the essence of the property 
business. That is, exploiting rights of land ownership for profit. But it is not intended 
to identify everything that must be taken into account in calculating the profits of such 
a business. The concept of the property business is wider than that. &#8220;Property 
business&#8221; includes, for example, amounts specifically charged under other provisions 
such as certain insurance recoveries (see clause 103 applied by clause 210(2)). 
 
771. Subsection (2) extends the meaning of &#8220;rents&#8221; and is based on section 24(6)(b) 
of ICTA. Including this extension in the main clause (in the source legislation it is 
relegated to a &#8220;construction&#8221; section) keeps all the relevant definitions together. 
 
772. Subsection (3) explains &#8220;other receipts&#8221; in subsection (1). This list is not 
exhaustive but amounts that are not listed here would have to be of a similar nature to 
those that are listed to come within the definition. 
 
773. Subsection (4) extends the charge to particular types of receipt. The source 
legislation cross-refers to a definition of &#8220;caravan&#8221; in the Caravan Sites and Control of 
Development Act 1960. There is a Bill-wide definition of &#8220;caravan&#8221; in clause 1314 
(and see Change 96 in Annex 1). &#8220;Houseboat&#8221; is defined in clause 1319 (other 
definitions). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="208" SerialNumber="237">Clause 208: Activities not for generating income from land 
774. This clause excludes certain &#8220;land-related&#8221; income from property income and 
cross-refers to the trading income provisions under which that income is charged. It is 
based on section 15(1) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 
267 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="3" SerialNumber="238">Chapter 3: Profits of property businesses: basic rules 
<Clause Number="209" SerialNumber="239">Clause 209: Charge to tax on profits of a property business 
775. This clause applies the corporation tax charge to the profits of a property 
business. It is based on sections 9, 15 and 18 of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="210" SerialNumber="240">Clause 210: Profits of a property business: application of trading income rules 
776. This is the main rule for calculating the profits of a property business. It is 
based on section 21A of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 
272 of ITTOIA. 
 
777. The same basic rules apply to the calculation of both UK and overseas 
property businesses. 
778. From 1998, the profits of a Schedule A business charged to corporation tax are 
calculated by treating the business as similar to a trade and applying the calculation 
rules of Schedule D Case I. 
 
779. In the source legislation this is achieved by section 21A of ICTA. But, at the 
margins, the application of certain of the Case I rules to Schedule A is not altogether 
clear. 
 
780. First, the relationship of section 21A(2) of ICTA to section 21A(1) of ICTA is 
uncertain. Section 21A(2) of ICTA refers to provisions that apply &#8220;in accordance&#8221; 
with section 21A(1). It is open to debate whether section 21A(2) of ICTA merely 
contains examples of the Schedule D Case I provisions that apply in accordance with 
the general rule in section 21A(1) of ICTA or whether it contains an exhaustive list of 
those provisions. The former appears the better view and the one best reflecting the 
underlying policy. 
 
781. Second, some Schedule D Case I provisions that are applied to Schedule A are 
inherently incapable of applying to income from land. The &#8220;herd basis&#8221; provisions in 
section 97 of, and Schedule 5 to, ICTA (rewritten in Chapter 8 of Part 3 of this Bill) 
are an example. They are among the provisions of Chapter 5 of Part 4 of ICTA that 
are applied to Schedule A specifically (subject to stated exceptions) by section 21A(2) 
of ICTA. But they are not among the exceptions referred to in section 21A(4) of 
ICTA. On the other hand, some Schedule D Case I provisions outside Chapter 5 of 
Part 4 of ICTA that seem potentially more relevant, such as the car hire provisions in 
sections 578A and 578B of ICTA, are not applied specifically. 
 
782. Clause 210 clarifies these matters by listing all the trading income provisions 
in Part 3 of this Bill that are relevant to property business profits. 
 
783. Some of the clauses in Part 3 of this Bill that are applied to a property business 
contain rewrite changes. Those changes are carried through to property income. 
Details of those changes are recorded in the Annex 1 notes on the particular clauses in 
Part 3. 
 
784. Subsection (2) lists all the provisions in Part 3 that are relevant to property 
business income. It reflects the principle that section 21A(1) of ICTA applies all 
Schedule D Case I calculation provisions to Schedule A unless they are expressly 
disapplied elsewhere. Provisions that are expressly disapplied in the source legislation 
are excluded from the list. 
 
785. Also excluded are provisions which are attracted to Schedule A in the source 
legislation either expressly by section 21A(2) of ICTA or under the general principle 
expressed in section 21A(1) of ICTA, but which are incapable of applying once 
carried over to the context of the property business. Exclusion is achieved simply by 
omitting them from the list of provisions that do apply. 
786. The majority of the provisions in Part 3 that can apply to a property business 
are applied by subsection (2). But in some cases later clauses set out the provisions 
specifically (clauses 261 and 262 (adjustment on change of basis) and the clauses in 
Chapter 9 of this Part (post-cessation receipts)). 
 
787. The following clauses that are applied by subsection (2) merit specific 
mention. These are: 
 
    &#8226; clauses 56 to 58: expenses of car hire; and 
 
    &#8226; clauses 172 to 175: deduction for unremittable amounts. 
 
788.   Including these accurately reflects the effect of section 21A(1) of ICTA. 
 
789. Although the list in subsection (2) excludes trading income provisions that are 
inherently incapable of applying to a property business it does not exclude those that 
are merely unlikely to apply. This recognises the possibility of certain provisions 
applying in unusual circumstances. Examples are clauses 87 and 88 (scientific 
research). Although their relevance to a property business is unlikely, it is not 
inconceivable and they are needed to cater for the possibility of a landlord funding an 
activity that would qualify as &#8220;scientific research&#8221;. An example might be research on 
the decontamination of brown land with a view to building an investment property on 
it. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="211" SerialNumber="241">Clause 211: Loan relationships and derivative contracts 
790. This clause defines the relationship of the rules in Parts 5 and 7 to those in this 
Part. It is based on section 15 of ICTA. 
 
791. Subsection (1) drops the words of the source &#8220;carried on by a company&#8221; in 
referring to a property business because in the context of corporation tax only 
legislation, they are redundant. 
 
792. Subsection (2) is based on the premise that, in the source legislation, the 
second sentence of paragraph 2(3) of Schedule A is really about the relationship 
between that provision and section 80(5) of FA 1996 and paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 
26 to FA 2002. The source makes a wide statement about the relationship between 
&#8220;this Schedule [A]&#8221; and Part 4 of FA 1996 and Schedule 26 to FA 2002. The Bill 
disposes of the concept of Schedule A so the rewritten references are necessarily more 
focussed. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="212" SerialNumber="242">Clause 212: Items treated as receipts and expenses 
793. This clause gives signposts to other relevant rules of calculation. It is new. 
 
794. In particular the CAA rules override the rules against the inclusion of capital 
items in clauses 53 and 93 of this Bill (applied to this Part by clause 210(2)). 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="213" SerialNumber="243">Clause 213: Certain amounts brought into account under Part 3 
795. This clause excludes from the profits of a property business certain income 
from land that, exceptionally, may be taxed as profits of a trade. It is based on 
section 15 of ICTA. See Changes 4, 5 and 6 in Annex 1 and the commentary on 
clauses 43, 44 and 45. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 273 of 
ITTOIA . 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="214" SerialNumber="244">Clause 214: Relationship between rules prohibiting and allowing deductions 
796. This clause determines the interaction between those provisions that prohibit a 
deduction and those provisions that allow a deduction. It is new. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 274 of ITTOIA. 
 
797. This clause does a similar job in Part 4 to that which clause 51 does in Part 3. 
The general principle is that a rule allowing a deduction takes priority over a rule 
prohibiting a deduction. But that is subject to the exceptions the clause mentions. See 
Change 7 in Annex 1. 
 
798. Subsection (4) makes it clear that the effect of this priority rule extends to the 
large number of trading income rules that apply to property income indirectly through 
clause 210. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="4" SerialNumber="245">Chapter 4: Profits of property businesses: lease premiums etc 
Overview 
799. This Chapter contains rules under which a company may be treated as 
receiving property business receipts in relation to certain lease premiums, or certain 
other amounts, which would otherwise generally be amounts of a capital nature. It 
also contains rules whereby relief can, in certain cases, be given to companies in 
relation to an earlier property business receipt that another person was treated as 
receiving. The Chapter is based on sections 34 to 38 and 42 of ICTA. The 
corresponding provisions for income tax are in Chapter 4 of Part 3 of ITTOIA. 
 
800. See clauses 62 to 67 for cases in which trading expenses are treated as 
incurred and deductible by reference to an earlier deemed lease receipt. See clause 
136 for a case in which trading receipts are reduced by property business receipts that 
are treated as arising under clauses 217 to 225. 
 
<Clause Number="215" SerialNumber="246">Clause 215: Overview of Chapter 
801. This clause provides an overview of the Chapter. It is new. The corresponding

</Clause><Clause Number="216" SerialNumber="247">Clause 216: Meaning of &#8220;short-term lease&#8221; 
802. This clause defines &#8220;short-term lease&#8221; as &#8220;a lease whose effective duration is 
50 years or less&#8221;. It is new. The corresponding provision for income tax is in section 
276 of ITTOIA. 
803. The &#8220;effective duration&#8221; of a lease is its duration for the purpose of this 
Chapter. This may not be the same as the contractual duration of the lease. See 
commentary on clauses 243 and 244. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="217" SerialNumber="248">Clause 217: Lease premiums 
804. This clause treats a property business receipt as arising if a premium is payable 
in relation to the grant of a short-term lease. It is based on sections 34(1), (6) and (7A) 
and 37(2) of ICTA. The corresponding provision for income tax is in section 277 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
805. Subsection (2) treats a company to which the premium is due as receiving an 
amount as a result of entering into a transaction mentioned in clause 205 (UK 
property business) or clause 206 (overseas property business), depending on the 
location of the land to which the lease relates. The effect is that the amount will be 
treated as a receipt of the company&#8217;s UK or overseas property business. 
 
806.   The approach adopted in subsection (2) is also followed in clauses 219 to 225. 
 
807. Subsection (3) requires the company to which the premium is due to bring the 
amount into account in calculating the profits of the property business for the 
accounting period in which the lease is granted. Source legislation is not explicit 
about the accounting period concerned in the case of a company which is not the 
landlord. See Change 43 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="218" SerialNumber="249">Clause 218: Amount treated as lease premium where work required 
808. This clause treats a lease premium as payable if a lease places an obligation on 
the tenant to carry out certain works. It is based on section 34(2) and (3) of ICTA. The 
corresponding provision for income tax is in section 278 of ITTOIA. 
 
809. Such treatment could lead to a property business receipt, or a greater receipt, 
being treated as arising to the landlord under clause 217. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="219" SerialNumber="250">Clause 219: Sums payable instead of rent 
810. This clause treats a property business receipt as arising in certain cases where 
a payment is made instead of rent for some or all of the duration of a lease. It is based 
on sections 34(1), (4), (6) and (7A) and 37(2) of ICTA. The corresponding provision 
for income tax is in section 279 of ITTOIA. 
 
811. Subsection (1) makes clear that, irrespective of the length of the lease, the 
payment of a sum instead of rent for a period of 50 years or less is within the scope of 
this clause. Source legislation is not explicit on this point. See Change 44 in Annex 1. 
 
812. Subsection (3) requires the company to which the sum is due to bring an 
amount into account in calculating the profits of its property business for the 
accounting period in which the sum is payable. Source legislation is not explicit about 
the accounting period concerned in the case of a company which is not the landlord. 
See Change 43 in Annex 1. 
 
813. In calculating the amount to be treated as received in respect of a sum in lieu 
of rent within section 34(4) of ICTA, the duration of the lease for the purposes of the 
formula in section 34(1) of ICTA must be adjusted in accordance with 
section 34(4)(a) of ICTA. For this purpose, there is excluded from the duration of the 
lease any period other than that in respect of which the sum in lieu of rent is paid. 
Subsections (4) and (6) have the same effect as those provisions of section 34(1) 
and (4)(a) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="220" SerialNumber="251">Clause 220: Sums payable for surrender of lease 
814. This clause treats a property business receipt as arising in certain cases where 
a sum is payable for the surrender of a short-term lease. It is based on 
sections 34(1), (4), (6) and (7A) and 37(2) of ICTA. The corresponding provision for 
income tax is in section 280 of ITTOIA. 
 
815. Subsection (3) requires the company to which the sum is due to bring an 
amount into account in calculating the profits of its property business for the 
accounting period in which the sum is payable. Source legislation is not explicit about 
the accounting period concerned in the case of a company which is not the landlord. 
See Change 43 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="221" SerialNumber="252">Clause 221: Sums payable for variation or waiver of terms of lease 
816. This clause treats a property business receipt as arising in certain cases where 
a payment is made for the variation or waiver of any of the terms of a lease. It is based 
on section 34(1), (5), (6), (7) and (7A) of ICTA. The corresponding provision for 
income tax is in section 281 of ITTOIA. 
 
817. Subsection (1) makes clear that, irrespective of the length of the lease, the 
payment of a sum as consideration for the variation or waiver of the terms of a lease 
for a period of 50 years or less is within the scope of this clause. Source legislation is 
not explicit on this point. See Change 44 in Annex 1. 
 
818. Subsection (1) also provides that this clause applies only if the sum is due to 
the landlord or to a connected company. Source legislation does not contain this 
restriction. See Change 45 in Annex 1. 
 
819. Subsection (3) requires the company to which the sum is due to bring an 
amount into account in calculating the profits of its property business for the 
accounting period in which the contract providing for the variation or waiver is 
entered into. Source legislation is not explicit about the accounting period concerned 
in the case of a company which is not the landlord. See Change 43 in Annex 1. 
820. Clause 227(1) extends relief under clause 228 (the additional calculation rule) 
to receipts in respect of sums payable for the variation or waiver of the terms of a 
lease. This is reflected in subsection (5) of this clause. See Change 46 in Annex 1. 
 
821. In calculating the amount to be treated as received in respect of a sum for the 
variation or waiver within section 34(5) of ICTA, the duration of the lease for the 
purposes of the formula in section 34(1) of ICTA must be adjusted in accordance with 
section 34(5)(a) of ICTA. For this purpose, there is excluded from the duration of the 
lease any period other than that in respect of which the variation or waiver has effect. 
Subsections (4) and (6) have the same effect as those provisions of section 34(1) 
and (5)(a) of ICTA.

822. This clause treats a property business receipt as arising in certain cases where 
a company makes a profit on the assignment of a lease that had been granted at an 
undervalue. It is based on sections 35(1), (2) and (2A) and 37(2) of ICTA. The 
corresponding provision for income tax is in section 282 of ITTOIA. 
 
823. The formula in subsection (4) for calculating the deemed receipt if there is an 
assignment at a profit is based on section 35(2) of ICTA (which refers back to the

825. This clause treats a property business receipt as arising in certain cases where 
a property is sold on terms which provide for the property to be reconveyed to the 
seller, or to a connected person, at less than the sale price. It is based on section 36(1) 
and (4A) of ICTA. The corresponding provision for income tax is in section 284 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
826. Subsection (1)(b) provides that this clause applies only if the period between 
sale and reconveyance is 50 years or less. Source legislation effectively applies if the

required) are not specified separately in subsection (1), or in clause 228(2), because 
clause 218(2) treats such amounts as premiums within clause 217. 
 
833. Subsection (3) sets out the connection that must exist between the lease in 
relation to which the taxed receipt arises and the lease in relation to which the later 
deemed business property receipt arises. 
 
834. Subsection (4)&#8217;s definitions of &#8220;taxed lease&#8221; and &#8220;taxed receipt&#8221; are based on 
the definitions of &#8220;head lease&#8221; and &#8220;amount chargeable on the superior interest&#8221; in 
section 37(1) of ICTA. The definition of a taxed lease, and taxed receipt, includes 
leases of land, and associated receipts, outside the UK. This restores a relief that was 
incorrectly removed by ITTOIA. See Change 48 in Annex 1. 
 
835. Subsection (5) stipulates that for clause 228 to apply there must be at least one 
taxed receipt with an &#8220;unused amount&#8221;. That is because clause 235 (limit on 
reductions and deductions) prevents relief being given under clause 228 by reference 
to a taxed receipt if that taxed receipt does not have an unused amount. Source 
legislation is not as explicit about the way in which relief in relation to a taxed receipt 
must not exceed the amount of the taxed receipt. See Change 49 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="228" SerialNumber="259">Clause 228: The additional calculation rule 
836. This clause provides for the amount of a deemed business property receipt to 
be reduced, in cases within clause 227, by reference to an earlier taxed receipt. It is 
based on section 37(2), (3), (7) and (9) of ICTA. The corresponding provision for 
income tax is in section 288 of ITTOIA. 
 
837. The amount to be reduced is referred to in this clause, and in clause 229, as 
&#8220;the receipt under calculation&#8221;. 
838. Clause 227 extends relief to deemed business property receipts arising in 
relation to the variation or waiver of the terms of a lease. Subsection (2) reflects this 
by referring to clause 221. See Change 46 in Annex 1. 
 
839. This clause introduces the label &#8220;basic relieving amount&#8221; for the amount by 
which the receipt under calculation is to be reduced. 
 
840. Subsection (3) requires the basic relieving amount to be restricted under 
clause 229(5) so that it does not exceed the amount of the receipt under calculation. 
Source legislation is not as explicit about what happens if relief is given in relation to 
more than one earlier taxed receipt. If there is more than one taxed receipt by 
reference to which the receipt under calculation may be reduced, it is for the company 
entitled to the relief to decide the order in which relief is to be taken by reference to 
those taxed receipts. 
 
841. For subsection (3) to apply there must be at least one taxed receipt with an 
&#8220;unused amount&#8221;. That is because clause 235 (limit on reductions and deductions) 
prevents relief under this clause being given by reference to a taxed receipt if that 
taxed receipt does not have an unused amount. Source legislation is not as explicit 
about the way in which relief in relation to a taxed receipt must not exceed the amount 
of the taxed receipt. See Change 49 in Annex 1. 
 
842. Subsection (4)&#8217;s use of the &#8220;unreduced amount&#8221; of the taxed receipt (defined 
in clause 230(2)) in the formula makes clear that the basic relieving amount by 
reference to a taxed receipt is to be calculated according to the amount of that receipt 
before any reductions or deductions. 
 
843. The definition in subsection (6) of &#8220;receipt period&#8221; in relation to a receipt 
under clauses 217 and 219 to 222 is based on the definition of &#8220;the period in respect 
of which an amount arose&#8221; in section 37(7)(b) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="229" SerialNumber="260">Clause 229: The additional calculation rule: special cases 
844. This clause: 
 
    &#8226; modifies the rule in clause 228 if the receipt under calculation arises in respect 
       of part only of the premises subject to the taxed lease; and 
 
    &#8226; sets limits on the reduction under that clause in two cases. 
 
It is based on section 37(2), (3) and (9) of ICTA. The corresponding provision for 
income tax is in section 289 of ITTOIA. 
 
845. Clause 227 extends relief under clause 228 to business property receipts 
treated as arising in relation to the variation or waiver of the terms of a lease. This is 
reflected in the reference in subsection (2) to clause 221. See Change 46 in Annex 1. 
846. But subsection (2) does not apply to receipts under clause 222 (assignments 
for profit of lease granted at undervalue) because it is not possible for a lease to be 
assigned other than in respect of the whole of the premises subject to the lease. 
 
847. Subsection (3) requires the fraction in subsection (2) to be calculated on a &#8220;just 
and reasonable basis&#8221;, where section 37(3) of ICTA requires a &#8220;just apportionment&#8221;. 
See Change 12 in Annex 1. 
 
848. Subsection (4) restricts the reduction calculated under clause 228(4) or 
subsection (2) of this clause to the &#8220;unused amount&#8221; of the taxed receipt by reference 
to which it is calculated. That is because giving greater relief would create a conflict 
with clause 235 (limit on reductions and deductions). Source legislation is not as 
explicit about the way in which relief in relation to a taxed receipt must not exceed the 
amount of the taxed receipt. See Change 49 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="230" SerialNumber="261">Clause 230: Meaning of &#8220;unused amount&#8221; and &#8220;unreduced amount&#8221; 
849. This clause is based on section 37(1), (8) and (9) of ICTA. The corresponding 
provision for income tax is in section 290 of ITTOIA. 
 
850. The &#8220;unused amount&#8221; of a taxed receipt is defined in subsections (1) and (5). 
That label is used by clauses 228 and 229 to ensure that relief given by reference to a 
taxed receipt under those clauses does not conflict with clause 235 (limit on 
reductions and deductions). Source legislation is not as explicit about the way in 
which relief in relation to a taxed receipt must not exceed the amount of the taxed 
receipt. See Change 49 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="231" SerialNumber="262">Clause 231: Deductions for expenses under section 232 
851. This clause provides business property deductions to a company for expenses 
that it is treated as incurring in respect of an earlier taxed receipt. This clause is based 
on section 37(4) and (9) of ICTA. The corresponding provision for income tax is in 
section 291 of ITTOIA. 
 
852. Subsection (2) provides that a deduction for an expense which the tenant is 
treated as incurring under clause 232 is allowed for each &#8220;qualifying day&#8221; on which 
all or part of the premises subject to the taxed lease is either occupied for the purposes 
of the tenant&#8217;s property business or is sublet. A &#8220;qualifying day&#8221; is defined in 
clause 232(3) as a day which falls within the receipt period of the taxed receipt. 
 
853. Subsection (3) provides that a deduction for an expense which a tenant is 
treated as incurring under clause 232 is subject to the application of any provision of 
Chapter 4 of Part 3 (rules restricting deductions). This is based on the source 
legislation providing that the amounts, corresponding to those in subsection (2), are 
treated as rent, whose deductibility is therefore subject to rules corresponding to those 
in Chapter 4 of Part 3. 
854. Subsection (4) provides that the deduction allowed in respect of an expense 
under clause 232 may be restricted to prevent the cap in clause 235, on the total relief 
which can be given by reference to a taxed receipt, being exceeded. See Change 49 in 
Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="232" SerialNumber="263">Clause 232: Tenants under taxed leases treated as incurring expenses 
855. This clause sets out the method of calculating the expense for which a 
deduction may be allowed under clause 231. It is based on section 37(4) of ICTA. The 
corresponding provision for income tax is in section 292 of ITTOIA. 
 
856. The formula in subsection (4) calculates the expense for each qualifying day 
by spreading the amount of the taxed receipt evenly over the receipt period of that 
receipt. Defining &#8220;A&#8221; in that formula as &#8220;the unreduced amount of the taxed receipt&#8221; 
makes clear that the amount of the expense which the tenant is treated as incurring for 
each qualifying day is calculated by reference to the amount of the taxed receipt 
before any reductions or deductions. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="233" SerialNumber="264">Clause 233: Restrictions on section 232 expenses: the additional calculation rule 
857. This clause supplements clause 232&#8217;s application to a taxed receipt where a 
lease premium receipt is also reduced by reference to that taxed receipt. It is based on 
sections 37(5) and (7) and 37A of ICTA. The corresponding provision for income tax 
is in section 293 of ITTOIA. 
 
858. Subsections (2) and (3) provide for a tenant to be treated as incurring an 
expense for a qualifying day under clause 232 only to the extent that the &#8220;daily 
amount of the taxed receipt&#8221; exceeds the &#8220;daily reduction of the lease premium 
receipt&#8221;. This prevents relief being lost in certain cases where more than one taxed 
receipt has been used to reduce the lease premium receipt to nil. See Change 13 in 
Annex 1. 
 
859. The daily amount of the taxed receipt and the daily reduction of the lease 
premium receipt are calculated according to the formulas in subsection (6): 
 
    &#8226; the formula for calculating the daily amount of the taxed receipt is the same 
       formula used in clause 232(4) to calculate the amount of the expense which the 
       tenant is treated as incurring for each qualifying day; and 
 
    &#8226; the formula for calculating the daily reduction of the lease premium receipt 
       spreads the reduction calculated under clause 228 or the corresponding section 
       in ITTOIA evenly over the receipt period of the lease premium receipt. 
 
860. Subsection (5) deals with the case where for a qualifying day a taxed receipt 
reduces more than one lease premium receipt. In such a case, the tenant is treated as 
incurring an expense for that day under clause 232 only to the extent that the daily 
amount of the taxed receipt exceeds the total of the daily reductions of each of the 
lease premium receipts. See Change 13 in Annex 1. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="234" SerialNumber="265">Clause 234: Restrictions on section 232 expenses: lease of part of premises 
861. This clause adapts clauses 232 and 233 for cases where the lease premium 
receipt arises in relation to only a part of the premises in respect of which the taxed 
receipt arose. It is based on sections 37(6) and 37A of ICTA. The corresponding 
provision for income tax is in section 294 of ITTOIA. 
 
862. Clause 227 extends relief under clause 228 to business property receipts 
treated as arising in relation to the variation or waiver of the terms of a lease. This is 
reflected in the reference in subsection (2) to clause 221. See Change 46 in Annex 1. 
 
863. Subsection (4) applies clauses 232 and 233 separately to that part of the 
premises in relation to which the lease premium receipt arises and to the remainder of 
the premises. And subsection (5) deals with the case where there is more than one 
sublease which does not extend to the whole of the landlord&#8217;s premises. See 
Change 13 in Annex 1. 
 
864. Subsection (6) adapts clauses 232 and 233 by multiplying the unreduced 
amount of the taxed receipt (&#8220;A&#8221;) by the fraction of the premises to which the lease 
premium relates in the formulas for calculating: 
 
    &#8226; the expense for a qualifying day in clause 232(4); and 
 
    &#8226; the daily amount of the taxed receipt in clause 233(6). 
 
865. Subsection (7) requires the fraction in subsection (6) to be calculated on a &#8220;just 
and reasonable basis&#8221;, where section 37(6) of ICTA is not explicit about the necessary 
basis of apportionment. See Change 12 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="235" SerialNumber="266">Clause 235: Limit on reductions and deductions 
866. This clause places a limit on the relief that can be given under this Chapter in 
relation to a taxed receipt. It is based on section 37(9) of ICTA. The corresponding 
provision for income tax is in section 295 of ITTOIA. 
 
867.   The clause restricts total relief in respect of a taxed receipt by way of: 
 
    &#8226; reductions under the additional calculation rule in clause 228; and 
 
    &#8226; deductions under clause 232. 
 
868. The total relief is restricted to the amount of the taxed receipt after the 
following (so far as given by reference to the taxed receipt): 
 
    &#8226; any reductions or deductions under sections 288 or 292 of ITTOIA (which 
       correspond to clauses 228 and 232 respectively); and 
    &#8226; any deductions under clause 63 (trading expense), or under section 61 of 
       ITTOIA (which corresponds to clause 63).

869. This clause provides for corporation tax, attributable to lease premium 
receipts, to be paid by instalments in certain cases. It is based on section 34(8) of 
ICTA. The corresponding provision for income tax is in section 299 of ITTOIA. 
 
870. Subsection (2) attributes the power to determine the amount and timing of 
instalments to an officer of Revenue and Customs where the source legislation refers 
to &#8220;the Board&#8221; (defined by source legislation to mean &#8220;the Commissioners of Inland 
Revenue&#8221;). See Change 1 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="237" SerialNumber="268">Clause 237: Statement of accuracy for purposes of section 222 
871. This clause provides for an officer of Revenue and Customs to certify a 
statement, made in cases where assignment of a lease does or may give rise to a taxed 
receipt, if satisfied that that the statement is accurate. It is based on section 35(3) of 
ICTA. The corresponding provision for income tax is in section 300 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="238" SerialNumber="269">Clause 238: Claim for repayment of tax payable by virtue of section 224 
872. This clause provides for corporation tax, paid in respect of a receipt under

on section 36(2) of ICTA. The corresponding provision for income tax is in 
section 301 of ITTOIA. 
 
873. Subsection (3) refers to a period of four years where the source legislation 
provides for six years. Schedule 2 preserves the six year period in the source

First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="243" SerialNumber="274">Clause 243: Rules for determining effective duration of lease 
880. This clause contains rules for determining the effective duration of a lease. It 
is based on section 38(1) and (6) of ICTA. The corresponding provisions for income 
tax are in section 303 of ITTOIA. 
 
881. Subsection (1) sets out various circumstances in which a lease may be treated 
as ceasing other than on the date specified in the lease. Rules 1, 2 and 3 are based on 
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) respectively of section 38(1) of ICTA. 
 
882. Rule 1 provides that the lease is treated as ending on the date beyond which it 
is unlikely that the lease will continue. See Change 50 in Annex 1. 
 
883. Subsection (3) is new. It ensures that all amounts that may give rise to a charge 
to tax by reason of clauses 218 to 221 are treated as premiums in applying Rule 1 in 
subsection (1). See Change 50 in Annex 1. 
 
884. Schedule 1 to this Bill amends section 303 of ITTOIA (rules for determining 
effective duration of lease) so that the changes also apply for income tax. See 
Change 50 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="244" SerialNumber="275">Clause 244: Applying the rules in section 243 
885. This clause supplements the rules in clause 243. It is based on 
section 38(2), (3) and (4) of ICTA. The corresponding provisions for income tax are 
in section 304 of ITTOIA. 
 
886. Section 38(4) of ICTA refers to benefits conferred and payments made for the 
purposes of securing a corporation tax advantage in the application of Part 2 of ICTA 
(provisions relating to the Schedule A charge) or an income tax advantage in the 
application of Chapter 4 of Part 3 of ITTOIA (profits of property businesses: lease 
premiums etc). 
 
887. Part 2 of ICTA consists of sections 21A to 42 of ICTA. Other than the lease 
premiums rules in sections 34 to 39, the sections of Part 2 of ICTA which are in force 
are sections 21A to 21C (calculation of the profits of a Schedule A business), 
section 24 (construction of Part 2), section 30 (sea walls), sections 31ZA to 31ZC 
(energy-saving items), section 40 (receipts and outgoings on sale of land) and 
section 42 (appeals against determinations under sections 34 to 36 of ICTA or 
Chapter 4 of Part 3 of ITTOIA). 
 
888. Sections 43A to 43G of ICTA were also in Part 2 of ICTA and could have 
applied to leases granted before 6 June 2006. But where those sections applied they 
gave rise to taxable receipts, rather than deductions from taxable income. 
 
889. It is considered that the only tax advantage that could be secured in the context 
of section 38(4) of ICTA would be under sections 34 to 37 of ICTA. So subsection (4) 
refers to a corporation tax advantage under this Chapter or an income tax advantage in 
the application of Chapter 4 of Part 3 of ITTOIA.

</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="5" SerialNumber="279">Chapter 5: Profits of property businesses: other rules about receipts and 
deductions 
Overview 
893. This Chapter contains provisions that supplement the basic calculation rules in 
Chapter 3 of this Part of the Bill. The corresponding rules for income tax are in 
Chapter 5 of Part 3 of ITTOIA. 
 
894. The provisions in this Chapter are about particular receipts or more unusual 
circumstances. 
 
<Clause Number="248" SerialNumber="280">Clause 248: Furnished lettings 
895. This clause brings the &#8220;letting&#8221; of furniture, when it is part and parcel of the 
letting of accommodation, within the property income charge. It is based on 
section 15 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 308 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
896. Without this provision, rent paid for use of the furniture in furnished lettings 
would not be included in the property income charge because the &#8220;rent&#8221; for the 
furniture does not derive from land. 
 
897. The purpose of subsection (1)(b) is to make it clear that related revenue 
expenses such as the expenses of repair and insurance of the furniture are deductible 
in calculating the profits of the property business. 
 
898. Subsection (2) excludes income and expenses where the hiring of the furniture 
is not simply incidental to exploiting an interest in land. 
 
899. Subsection (4)(a) refers to a &#8220;caravan and a houseboat&#8221;. There is a Bill-wide 
definition of &#8220;caravan&#8221; in clause 1314: see the commentary on clause 1314 and 
Change 96 in Annex 1. &#8220;Houseboat&#8221; is defined in clause 1319 (other definitions), the 
corporation tax equivalent of section 878 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="249" SerialNumber="281">Clause 249: Acquisition of business: receipts from transferor&#8217;s UK property 
business 
900. This clause sets out what happens if a successor to a property business 
receives a sum that arose from the business when it was carried on by the predecessor. 
It is based on sections 21B and 106 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is 
in section 310 of ITTOIA. 
 
901. Subsection (2) treats the &#8220;sum&#8221; received as a receipt of the property business. 
As this rule affects the calculation of the profits of a property business it appears in 
this Chapter rather than with the post-cessation receipt rules, where it is in the source 
legislation. 
 
902. The source legislation applies &#8220;for all purposes&#8221;. This clause applies for 
corporation tax purposes. Section 310 of ITTOIA applies for income tax purposes. 
Section 37(1) of TCGA (as construed in accordance with section 8(4) of TCGA) 
ensures that any sums received as a result of the transfer are not charged to 
corporation tax on a company&#8217;s chargeable gains. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="250" SerialNumber="282">Clause 250: Reverse premiums 
903. This clause sets out the rules for taxing reverse premiums as receipts of a 
property business. It is based on Schedule 6 to FA 1999. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 311 of ITTOIA. 
 
904. Subsection (1) refers to a &#8220;reverse premium&#8221;. In accordance with 
subsection (6) that expression has the same meaning as in clause 96. So this clause 
applies to reverse premiums excluding any of the &#8220;excluded cases&#8221; within clause 97. 
The subsection also excludes any reverse premium that is charged to tax as a trade 
receipt by clause 98. 
 
905. Subsections (2) and (3) bring the reverse premium within the scope of the 
property income rules as United Kingdom or overseas property business even if the 
recipient is not already carrying on a property business. 
 
906. Schedule 2 to this Bill rewrites the transitional provision in section 54(2) of 
FA 1999. This clause does not apply to pre 9 March 1999 reverse premiums. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="251" SerialNumber="283">Clause 251: Deduction for expenditure on energy-saving items 
907. This clause provides a deduction for certain expenditure on energy-saving 
items where that expenditure would not otherwise be allowable because it is capital. It 
is based on section 31ZA of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="252" SerialNumber="284">Clause 252: Restrictions on relief 
908. This clause imposes certain restrictions on the relief that would otherwise be 
due under clause 251. It is based on section 31ZB of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="253" SerialNumber="285">Clause 253: Regulations 
909. This clause provides for the Treasury&#8217;s powers to make regulations for the 
purposes stated. It is based on section 31ZC of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="254" SerialNumber="286">Clause 254: Deduction for expenditure on sea walls 
910. This is the first of four clauses that provide relief to a landlord for making a 
sea wall or other embankment to protect let premises against flooding by the sea or a 
tidal river. The corresponding rules for income tax are in sections 315 to 318 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
911. This clause states the circumstances in which the relief is given. It is based on 
section 30(1), (4) and (5) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 315 of ITTOIA. 
 
912. Subsection (2) makes it clear that to obtain a deduction for sea walls 
expenditure, the person carrying on the property business and the person incurring the 
sea walls expenditure must be the same person. This may appear to be stating the 
obvious but section 30(1) of ICTA says merely that the person incurring the 
expenditure is treated as making a payment &#8220;for the purpose of computing the profits 
of any Schedule A business carried on in relation to those premises&#8221; (emphasis 
added). This does not mean literally any such business carried on by someone other 
than the person incurring the expenditure: there would be no point in deeming the 
payment to be made by that person if it were otherwise. And the provisions on 
transfer of interests in section 30(2) to (3) of ICTA reflect the notion that the deemed 
payment, and hence the right to relief, moves from the former owner to the transferee. 
There is no suggestion of involvement by any other party. 
913. Subsection (3) defines the &#8220;deduction period&#8221; referred to in subsection (2). 
Qualifying expenditure is deducted over 21 years in calculating the profits of the 
property business. The &#8220;deduction period&#8221; is comparable to the &#8220;writing-down 
period&#8221; over which expenditure qualifying for capital allowances is written off. This 
reflects the similarity between the relief given by the sea walls provisions and certain 
capital allowances provisions. The relief is for expenditure which would otherwise be 
capital in nature. And the expenditure is not relieved all at once but over a period, 
even if there are changes in the person who obtains the relief. 
 
914. Subsection (5) is based on section 30(4) of ICTA which deals with the unusual 
fact that for corporation tax purposes sea walls relief is given by reference to a year of 
assessment (&#8220;tax year&#8221; in ITTOIA and this Bill). A year of assessment is not a term 
that is normally relevant to corporation tax where the relevant measures of time are 
financial years and accounting periods. &#8220;Tax year&#8221; is defined in a clause 1319 (other 
definitions), the equivalent for corporation tax purposes of section 878 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="255" SerialNumber="287">Clause 255: Transfer of interest in premises 
915. This clause deals with the case where the person who incurred the sea walls 
expenditure sells the premises during the 21 year period over which the deduction is 
due. It is based on section 30(2) and (3) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income 
tax is in section 316 of ITTOIA. 
 
916. Subsection (1) applies to transfers of the relevant interest &#8220;whether by 
operation of law or otherwise&#8221;. These words derive directly from the source 
legislation. They ensure that the provision applies to, for example, successions to 
estates as well as the sort of merger of interests envisaged in clause 256. 
 
917. Subsection (2)(b) requires any apportionment to be &#8220;just and reasonable&#8221; 
whereas section 30(2)(a) of ICTA refers simply to an apportionment that is &#8220;just&#8221;. 
This change reflects the approach that was adopted in CAA and which has been 
followed in similar contexts elsewhere for consistency. There is no practical 
difference between the two forms of words. See Change 12 in Annex 1. 
 
918. Subsection (5) makes explicit what is merely implicit in the source legislation, 
namely, the extent of the transferor&#8217;s entitlement to a deduction in subsequent years. 
In particular, subsection (5)(a) makes it clear that if the transfer is of only part of the 
premises, the transferor continues to be entitled to a deduction in relation to the part 
not transferred. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="256" SerialNumber="288">Clause 256: Ending of lease of premises 
919. This clause deals with the case where the sea walls expenditure is incurred by 
a lessee and the lease comes to an end before the end of the deduction period. It is 
based on section 30(3) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 317 of ITTOIA. 
920. The cases to which subsection (3) applies include renewals of the lease to the 
same person. Then the deduction passes to the immediate reversioner. 
 
921. In the source legislation &#8220;lease&#8221; is defined for the purposes of the sea walls 
provisions in section 24(6)(a) of ICTA. But that definition is redundant and, since it 
no longer applies to any other provision, is not rewritten in this Bill. It is redundant in 
the sea walls context for the following reasons. 
 
922. Section 24(6)(a) of ICTA defines references to a lease as extending only to a 
lease conferring a right, as against the person whose interest is subject to the lease, to 
the possession of the premises. It originated as paragraph 16 of Schedule 4 to 
FA 1963. Notes on Clauses to FA 1963 explain that the reference to possession was to 
ensure that a &#8220;lease&#8221; in Schedule A and sections 25 to 31 of ICTA must be one of land 
and not of incorporeal hereditament. So a lease of sporting rights, or a right of way, 
would not be covered. However, Street v Mountford [1985], AC 809 established that 
a &#8220;lease&#8221; of land which does not confer on the tenant exclusive possession is not, in 
fact, a lease but a licence. 
 
923. Section 30(2) of ICTA does not explain the meaning of the transfer of the 
whole of a person&#8217;s interest in any premises or part of any premises. The transfer of 
the whole of a person&#8217;s interest is significant because it can lead to the transfer of 
entitlement to a deduction for sea walls expenditure. But entitlement to a deduction 
for sea walls expenditure does not arise anyway unless a person is the owner or tenant 
of premises. A lease which makes a person a tenant of premises is not a lease of an 
incorporeal hereditament. So, although section 30 of ICTA does not expressly exclude 
leases of incorporeal hereditaments, to the extent that they might cover leases of 
incorporeal hereditaments references to &#8220;leases&#8221; in that provision are simply 
redundant. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="257" SerialNumber="289">Clause 257: Transfer involving person within the charge to income tax 
924. This clause ensures that entitlement to a deduction for expenditure on sea 
walls continues properly when the interest in the premises is transferred between a 
corporation tax payer and an income tax payer. It is based on section 30(2A) of ICTA. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 318 of ITTOIA. 
 
925. Entitlement to a deduction for expenditure on sea walls can be transferred with 
ownership of the premises. That transfer can be between a corporation tax payer and 
an income tax payer. Clause 255 deals with transfers between corporation tax payers. 
But it cannot deal with a transfer from a corporation tax payer to an income tax payer 
or the reverse because the provisions in this Bill apply only to corporation tax payers. 
 
926. Clause 257 allows the seawalls provisions in this Bill to work properly in 
respect of the party to the transfer who is subject to corporation tax. 
 
927. Subsection (4) signposts to the provisions in ITTOIA that deal with the party 
to the transfer who is subject to income tax. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="258" SerialNumber="290">Clause 258: Relief in respect of mineral royalties 
928. This clause provides that only half the net profits received in respect of 
mineral royalties are charged to corporation tax on income. It is based on section 122 
of ICTA. The other half of the profits are charged to corporation tax on chargeable 
gains by section 201 of TCGA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 319 of ITTOIA. 
 
929. The clause applies only to mineral royalties that are not taxed under Chapter 7 
of this Part. That Chapter taxes rents and royalties from concerns such as mines and 
quarries. In practice nearly all mineral royalties will be taxed under Chapter 7 of 
Part 4 of this Bill. For this reason this clause cross-refers to the definitions in that 
Chapter. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="259" SerialNumber="291">Clause 259: Nature of item apportioned on sale of estate or interest in land 
930. This clause preserves the capital or revenue nature of an amount due, or 
payable in arrears, that is apportioned to a seller on the sale of land. It is based on 
section 40(3)(b) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 320 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
931. Most of section 40 of ICTA is not rewritten because it has become redundant 
following the application of Schedule D Case I principles to Schedule A. 
 
932. The original predecessor of section 40 of ICTA (section 20 of FA 1964) was 
introduced to deal with a specific problem. That was reflecting, in the calculation of 
income from land, any apportionments of rent (as a receipt or an expense) that took 
place between seller and purchaser when land was sold. That required two kinds of 
rule. The first were calculation rules. They were necessary because at the time 
section 20 of FA 1964 was introduced the charge on income from land was based on 
entitlement to incoming rent and payment of outgoing rent. Where there were 
apportionments on sale there might be neither entitlement nor payment by the &#8220;right&#8221; 
person. The second were timing rules to ensure that the consequential adjustments fell 
in the right tax year. 
 
933. As a result of the 1995 Schedule A reforms and their application, in 1998, to 
corporation tax, these rules are no longer necessary. Two main factors lead to this 
conclusion. 
 
934. The first relates to the object of charge under Schedule A: the profit of a 
Schedule A business. For there to be a Schedule A business a person has to be 
exploiting United Kingdom land for rent (section 15(1)1(1) of ICTA). In order to be a 
receipt (or outgoing) of the Schedule A business it is enough that an amount relates to 
a period when the person was exploiting the land. 
 
935. The second factor relates to the time when income within the charge is brought 
into account. Accounting principles have been imported from Schedule D Case I into 
Schedule A. These principles bring an item into account in the period to which it 
relates. So the rules in section 40(1) to (3) of ICTA about the time of receipt and 
payment are unnecessary. 
 
936. Section 40(4) of ICTA is similarly now unnecessary. It provides that any 
reference in section 40(1) and (2) of ICTA to a party to a contract includes a person to 
whom the rights and obligations of that party under the contract have passed by 
assignment or otherwise. Since the test of whether or not an item is to be brought into 
account under Schedule A is whether it arises from a person&#8217;s exploitation of land 
then whether the rights and obligations under the contract pass by assignment or 
otherwise, the person to whom they pass will be the person exploiting the land. 
 
937. Section 40(4A) of ICTA is not rewritten. It is linked to the parts of section 40 
of ICTA that are unnecessary and also gives in certain circumstances the wrong result. 
 
938. Section 40(3)(b) of ICTA has a clear anti-avoidance purpose that is preserved 
in clause 259. But it also contains a timing rule. The timing rule in section 40(3)(b) of 
ICTA is not rewritten because accounting principles again attribute the apportioned 
amount to the correct period. 
 
939. This clause rewrites the anti-avoidance part of section 40(3)(b) of ICTA which 
preserves the capital or revenue nature of any amount due or paid in arrears and 
apportioned by the buyer to the seller on the sale of land. 
 
940. The time of apportionment referred to in the clause is normally the time of 
completion of the sale. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="260" SerialNumber="292">Clause 260: Mutual business 
941. This clause makes it clear that the concept of &#8220;mutuality&#8221; does not apply in the 
property income context. It is based on section 21C of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 321 of ITTOIA. 
 
942. Mutuality is a concept that has been developed by the courts over a long 
period. It derives from the principle that one cannot make a profit by dealing with 
oneself. It may arise in the trading context where a class of contributors to a common 
fund are entitled, as a class, to share in the surpluses of that fund. 
 
943. The approach in this clause differs from that of the source and is simpler. The 
approach in section 21C of ICTA is to apply the normal profit calculation rules to any 
&#8220;mutual business&#8221; and add the result to the profits of the rest of the Schedule A 
business. This clause on the other hand prevents, from the outset, the concept of 
mutuality operating on amounts within this Part of this Bill. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="261" SerialNumber="293">Clause 261: Adjustment on change of basis 
944. This clause sets out the circumstances in which an adjustment may arise. It is 
based on section 64 of FA 2002. The equivalent rule for trades is in clause 180. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 329 of ITTOIA. 
945. In the source legislation the change of basis rules apply to a Schedule A 
business because they are &#8220;other rules applicable to Case I of Schedule D&#8221; (see 
section 21B of ICTA). On the other hand, for an overseas property business 
section 70A(5) of ICTA imports only &#8220;the rules applicable to the computation of the 
profits&#8221; (see section 21A of ICTA). So the change of basis rules do not apply to an 
overseas property business. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="262" SerialNumber="294">Clause 262: Giving effect to positive and negative adjustments 
946. This clause sets out how to calculate an adjustment and how it is treated for 
tax purposes. It is based on paragraphs 2 and 4 to 7 of Schedule 22 to FA 2002. The 
corresponding rules for income tax are in sections 330, 333 and 334 of ITTOIA. 
 
947. Subsection (6) is a cross-reference to the trading income rule about expenses 
for which a deduction has already been made. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="263" SerialNumber="295">Clause 263: Expenditure on integral features 
948. This clause draws attention to the rule in section 33A(3) of CAA. There is a 
signpost to that rule in section 74(1)(da) of ICTA. That subsection is repealed. The 
signpost is not formally rewritten but it is replaced in this clause (and in the trading 
income clause 60). 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="6" SerialNumber="296">Chapter 6: Commercial letting of furnished holiday accommodation 
Overview 
949. The clauses in this Chapter define the lettings that can qualify for special tax 
advantages: &#8220;the commercial letting of furnished holiday accommodation&#8221;. They are 
based on section 504 of ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in 
sections 322 to 327 of ITTOIA. 
 
950. The clauses do not, themselves, provide for the tax advantages. That is the 
function of the particular &#8220;relieving&#8221; provisions (such as the loss relief provisions) 
that are cross-referred to. 
 
951. The primary purpose of this Chapter is to provide a central definition of this 
particular type of letting, income from which benefits from tax advantages provided 
for in other Acts. 
 
952. This income is part of the single property business denoted in clause 205 and 
chargeable therefore under this Part. 
 
<Clause Number="264" SerialNumber="297">Clause 264: Overview of Chapter 
953. This clause is introductory and explanatory. It is new. It makes clear that the 
provisions that provide for the tax advantages are to be found elsewhere. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 322 of ITTOIA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="265" SerialNumber="298">Clause 265: Meaning of &#8220;commercial letting of furnished holiday 
accommodation&#8221; 
954. This clause defines the lettings that can benefit from the special tax treatment. 
It is based on section 504 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 323 of ITTOIA. 
 
955. It is not sufficient that the letting is simply of furnished holiday 
accommodation: it must also be &#8220;qualifying holiday accommodation&#8221;. 
Subsection (3)(b) provides a signpost to the clauses that define &#8220;qualifying holiday 
accommodation&#8221;. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="266" SerialNumber="299">Clause 266: Meaning of &#8220;relevant period&#8221; in sections 267 and 268 
956. This clause defines the period during which certain conditions need to be 
satisfied in order to benefit from the special tax treatment. It is based on 
section 504(5) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 324 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
957. Subsection (4) gives the general rule and identifies the relevant period for the 
case where there is established and continuing letting. It follows the source legislation 
(in section 504(5)(c) of ICTA) by putting the general rule covering what is likely to be 
the most common case, last. This is because the company still needs to read the first 
two rules to know whether it falls within the general rule. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="267" SerialNumber="300">Clause 267: Meaning of &#8220;qualifying holiday accommodation&#8221; 
958. This clause sets out the additional tests the letting must satisfy to qualify for 
the special treatment. It is based on section 504(3) and (5) of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 325 of ITTOIA. 
 
959. Subsection (1), which is based on section 504(3), introduces the term 
&#8220;qualifying holiday accommodation&#8221; and defines it by reference to the three 
conditions that are set out in the subsequent subsections. 
 
960. Subsection 504(3) of ICTA is particularly complex. The three tests it imposes 
in paragraphs (a) to (c) are referred to in the subsequent subsections of this clause as, 
respectively, the &#8220;availability&#8221;, &#8220;letting&#8221; and &#8220;pattern of occupation&#8221; conditions. If all 
three are met, the accommodation is &#8220;qualifying holiday accommodation&#8221;. 
 
961. Subsections (4) to (6) are based on section 504(3)(c) of ICTA. 
Section 504(3)(c) of ICTA is particularly ambiguous and this clause seeks to reduce 
that ambiguity. The approach differs from that in the source legislation and involves a 
change that alters the period during which, in order to qualify for the special 
treatment, the accommodation must not be occupied for more than 31 days at a time. 
See Change 51 in Annex 1. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="268" SerialNumber="301">Clause 268: Under-used holiday accommodation: averaging elections 
962. This clause allows accommodation that would be &#8220;qualifying holiday 
accommodation&#8221;, were it not simply for insufficient actual letting, nevertheless to 
qualify if, on average, the letting condition in clause 267(3) is met. It is based on 
section 504(6) to (8) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 326 
of ITTOIA. 
 
963. Subsection (1) introduces a new term, &#8220;under-used accommodation&#8221;, to denote 
this accommodation. 
 
964. Subsection (4) introduces a change. This changes the period over which 
lettings are averaged for the purpose of treating infrequently let property as qualifying 
holiday accommodation from the accounting period to the relevant period (as defined 
in clause 266). See Change 52 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="269" SerialNumber="302">Clause 269: Capital allowances and loss relief 
965. This clause provides for separate calculations in order to give effect to the tax 
advantages of qualifying holiday lettings. It is new. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 327 of ITTOIA. 
 
966. There is no explicit requirement for separate furnished holiday lettings 
calculations in section 503 of ICTA. But it is clearly not possible to give effect to the 
special corporation tax treatments available to furnished holiday lettings without 
separating out the relevant income and expenditure. Requiring, where appropriate, 
separate calculations makes explicit what is only implicit in section 503 of ICTA. 
 
967.     This clause provides a mechanism to ensure that the special rules that can 
give tax advantages in respect of these lettings work properly and clearly in the 
context of a UK property business of which the furnished holiday lettings is part: the 
profit from such lettings must be identified separately but only when there is a 
practical need to do so. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="7" SerialNumber="303">Chapter 7: Rent receivable in connection with a UK section 39(4) concern 
Overview 
968. This Chapter charges as property income rent receivable in connection with a 
section 39(4) concern. It also provides for certain deductions and reliefs to be given 
from that income. 
 
969. This Chapter makes the relationship between the rules derived from 
sections 119 (rent payable in connection with mines, quarries and similar concerns) 
and 122 (relief in respect of mineral royalties) of ICTA clear. So section 201(2) of 
TCGA (mineral leases: royalties) is omitted, see Part 2 of Schedule 1 to this Bill. 

 
<Clause Number="270" SerialNumber="304">Clause 270: Charge to tax on rent receivable in connection with a UK 
section 39(4) concern 
970. This clause applies the charge to corporation tax to rent receivable in 
connection with a &#8220;UK section 39(4) concern&#8221;. It is based on section 119 of ICTA. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 335 of ITTOIA. 
 
971. The loss regime in section 396 of ICTA applies to income charged under this 
Chapter and not the regime in section 392A of ICTA. 
 
972. The charge under Schedule D Case III imposed by section 119(2) of ICTA is 
not rewritten. It is otiose. See Change 53 in Annex 1. This Change reproduces 
Change 158 in ITTOIA in relation to section 119(2) of ICTA and so brings the 
income and corporation tax codes back into line. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="271" SerialNumber="305">Clause 271: Meaning of &#8220;rent receivable in connection with a UK section 39(4) 
concern&#8221; 
973. This clause clarifies: 
 
    &#8226; what is meant by &#8220;UK section 39(4) concern&#8221;; 
 
    &#8226; what is meant by &#8220;rent&#8221;; and 
 
    &#8226; when rent is treated as &#8220;receivable in connection with&#8221; such a concern. 
 
974. It is based on section 119 of ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are 
in section 336 of ITTOIA. 
 
975. Subsection (1) identifies when rent is receivable in connection with a &#8220;UK 
section 39(4) concern&#8221;. It uses the language of clause 207(1) (meaning of &#8220;generating 
income from land&#8221;) to rewrite the phrase &#8220;in respect of any land or easement&#8221; in 
section 119(1) of ICTA. Clause 207 is based on paragraph 1(1) of Schedule A 
(section 15(1) of ICTA). The concept in clause 207 of &#8220;generating income from land&#8221; 
serves to determine the scope of Schedule A. The approach in this clause assumes that 
the income taxed by section 119 of ICTA would otherwise have been taxed under 
Schedule A. 
 
976. The justification for this assumption is that section 119 of ICTA can have no 
application to income that is already taxed under Schedule D Case VI. Neither is there 
any question that the rent would go untaxed if it were not for section 119 of ICTA. 
Rents are clearly annual profits or gains as described in Schedule D Case VI of ICTA. 
The effect of section 119 of ICTA is to take income that would be taxed under 
Schedule A and tax it under Schedule D. So in identifying the scope of the charge it is 
possible to use the ordinary property business definitions and avoid the need to 
rewrite the complicated definitions of &#8220;easement&#8221; and &#8220;rent&#8221; in section 119(3) of 
ICTA. 
977. The section makes explicit a territorial restriction to the United Kingdom that 
is implicit in section 119(1) of ICTA. If a &#8220;UK section 39(4) concern&#8221; is located 
outside the United Kingdom it would be a foreign possession for the purposes of the 
charge under Schedule D Case V. Any income arising from such a possession would 
have been taxed under Schedule D Case V. Section 119 of ICTA could have had no 
application to income that was already taxed under Schedule D. 
 
978. Subsection (3) provides the definition of rent. It is based on section 119(3) of 
ICTA. As explained in the commentary on subsection (1), this clause is based on the 
assumption that the rents taxed by section 119 of ICTA would otherwise have been 
taxed under Schedule A. This means it is not necessary to reproduce the definition of 
&#8220;rent&#8221; in section 119(3) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="272" SerialNumber="306">Clause 272: Deduction for management expenses of owner of mineral rights 
979. This clause allows a deduction for the expenses of managing mineral rights. It 
is based on section 121 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 339 of ITTOIA. 
 
980. Subsection (1) sets out the conditions for the clause to apply. It does not 
reproduce the condition that the expenses must be incurred &#8220;necessarily&#8221;. See 
Change 54 in Annex 1. The &#8220;necessarily&#8221; test is impractical in this context. This 
change reproduces Change 78 in ITTOIA and so brings the income and corporation 
tax codes back into line. 
 
981. Subsection (2) provides that a deduction is allowed for the qualifying expenses 
paid in the accounting period. This rewrites the requirement that the expenses are 
&#8220;disbursed&#8221; in the period. 
 
982. The relief applies only to rents received from a &#8220;UK section 39(4) concern&#8221;. If 
the income is taxed as income from a UK property business there is no need for 
special rules identifying what deductions are allowable. The normal rules apply. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="273" SerialNumber="307">Clause 273: Relief in respect of mineral royalties 
983. This clause provides that only half of the net profit earned in respect of 
mineral royalties is charged to corporation tax. It is based on section 122 of ICTA. 
The other half of the net profit is charged to corporation tax on chargeable gains by 
section 201 of TCGA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 340 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
984. Subsection (1) limits the relief to royalties taxed under this Chapter of this 
Bill. If the royalty is not taxed under this Chapter the same relief is given by 
clause 135 or clause 258. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="274" SerialNumber="308">Clause 274: Meaning of &#8220;mineral lease or agreement&#8221; and &#8220;mineral royalties&#8221; 
985. This clause defines various terms used in clause 273. It is based on section 122 
of ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 341 of ITTOIA. 
986. Clause 291 includes a definition of &#8220;lease&#8221; that applies for the purposes of this 
Part. It is based on section 24 of ICTA, which applies for the purposes of Schedule A 
in the source legislation. Because the definition applies only for Schedule A in 
strictness it does not extend to the income taxed under clause 273. But the definition 
of &#8220;mineral lease or agreement&#8221; in section 122(6) of ICTA applies to any agreement 
conferring a right to win and work minerals in the United Kingdom. Such an 
agreement would also satisfy the definition in section 24 of ICTA so there is no 
change in the law. 
 
987. The legislation rewritten by subsection (2) does not include any rent receivable 
before 6 April 1970. This limitation is preserved in Schedule 2 (transitionals and 
savings).

different rules that apply to the ownership of mineral rights in Northern Ireland. It is 
based on section 122 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 342 of ITTOIA. 
 
989. The right to win, and win and work, most minerals in Northern Ireland is 
vested in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI). The DETI will 
grant licences to work the minerals and make compensatory payments to the former 
owners of the mineral rights under various Acts of the Northern Ireland Parliament. 
This clause treats those payments as mineral royalties for the purposes of clause 273. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="276" SerialNumber="310">Clause 276: Power to determine what counts as &#8220;mineral royalties&#8221; 
990. This clause allows the Commissioners to make regulations concerning the 
application of the relief in clause 273. It is based on section 122 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 343 of ITTOIA. Any regulations made 
under this power would apply also to clauses 135 and 258 through clauses 135(3) 
and 258(3). 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="8" SerialNumber="311">Chapter 8: Rent receivable for UK electric-line wayleaves 
Overview 
991. This Chapter rewrites the Schedule D Case VI charge on rent received for a 
wayleave granted in the United Kingdom. It is based on section 120 of ICTA. 
 
992. If a landowner receives rent for a UK electric-line wayleave section 120 of 
ICTA provides that: 
 
    &#8226; the rent is charged under Schedule A if the landowner receives other rent in 
       respect of the same land; otherwise 
 
    &#8226; the rent is charged under Schedule D. 
993. In practice this meant that if the landowner carries on a trade on the land the 
rent can be treated as a trade receipt. Otherwise the rent was taxed under Schedule D 
Case VI. 
 
994. Section 396 of ICTA gives the rules for dealing with Schedule D Case VI 
losses. In order to preserve that loss regime it is necessary to isolate the income that 
ICTA charges under Schedule D Case VI. 
 
<Clause Number="277" SerialNumber="312">Clause 277: Charge to tax on rent receivable for a UK electric-line wayleave 
995. This clause applies the charge to corporation tax to rent receivable for a UK 
electric-line wayleave. It is based on section 120 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 344 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="278" SerialNumber="313">Clause 278: Meaning of &#8220;rent receivable for a UK electric-line wayleave&#8221; 
996. This clause provides the definition of &#8220;rent receivable for a UK electric-line 
wayleave&#8221;. It is based on section 120 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax 
is in section 345 of ITTOIA. 
 
997. Section 120(1) of ICTA identifies the right in respect of which the rent is 
payable as an &#8220;easement&#8221;. Section 120(5) of ICTA cross-refers to the definition of 
&#8220;easement&#8221; in section 119(3) of ICTA. Section 119 of ICTA is rewritten in Chapter 7 
of this Part. As explained in the commentary on clause 45 both this Chapter and 
clause 45 use the term &#8220;wayleave&#8221; to describe the right in respect of which the rent is 
received. In practice this is how most of the payments covered by this clause are 
usually described. But the generality of the words in section 119(3) of ICTA has not 
been lost. The clause also uses the Scottish term for &#8220;easement&#8221;, &#8220;servitude&#8221;. 
 
998. Subsection (2) clarifies the meaning of &#8220;electric, telegraph or telephone wire 
or cable&#8221;. It does not repeat the reference to &#8220;transformer&#8221; in the source legislation. In 
its context it is clear that &#8220;apparatus&#8221; would include &#8220;transformer&#8221;. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="279" SerialNumber="314">Clause 279: Extent of charge to tax 
999. This clause sets out the two exceptions under which the rent received in 
respect of a UK electric-line wayleave is not taxed under this Chapter. It is based on 
section 120 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 346 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
1000. Subsections (1) and (2) deal with the case in which the company receives other 
rent in respect of the land except rent from another wayleave. The rent from the 
wayleave is taxed as property income. 
 
1001. Subsections (3) and (4) deal with the case in which the company carries on a 
trade on the land. See Change 6 in Annex 1 and the commentary on clause 45. The 
rent may be taxed as a trade receipt. 

 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="9" SerialNumber="315">Chapter 9: Post-cessation receipts 
Overview 
1002. This Chapter applies the rules about post-cessation receipts to UK property 
businesses, broadly as they apply to trades. The main rules for trades are in 
Chapter 15 of Part 3 of this Bill. The application of the rules to property businesses is 
based on section 21B of ICTA, which specifically mentions sections 103 to 106 of 
ICTA. 
 
1003. Although the post-cessation receipt rules apply to a Schedule A business, they 
do so by virtue of section 21B of ICTA. That section deals with &#8220;other rules 
applicable to Case I of Schedule D&#8221;. On the other hand, section 21A of ICTA deals 
with rules about the computation of profits of a trade. So section 70A of ICTA 
imports only the computation rules in section 21A and the post-cessation receipt rules 
do not apply to an overseas property business. 
 
1004. A property business cannot have trading stock. So clause 195 (transfer of 
trading stock) does not have a corresponding rule in this Chapter. 
 
1005. The following trading income rules apply to property businesses but are not in 
separate clauses in this Chapter: 
 
    &#8226; clauses 192 and 193: rules about debts (these rules are applied by 
       clause 283(2)); and 
 
    &#8226; clauses 196 and 197: allowable deductions (these rules are applied by 
       clause 285). 
 
<Clause Number="280" SerialNumber="316">Clause 280: Charge to tax on post-cessation receipts 
1006. This clause applies the corporation tax charge on income to post-cessation 
receipts. It is based on sections 103 and 104 of ICTA, as applied by section 21B of 
ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 349 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="281" SerialNumber="317">Clause 281: Extent of charge to tax 
1007. This clause restricts the charge on the post-cessation receipts. It is based on 
sections 103 and 104 of ICTA, as applied by section 21B of ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 350 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="282" SerialNumber="318">Clause 282: Basic meaning of &#8220;post-cessation receipt&#8221; 
1008. This clause defines post-cessation receipts of a UK property business. It is 
based on sections 103, 104 and 110 of ICTA, as applied by section 21B of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 353 of ITTOIA. 
 
1009. Subsection (2) explains that a person permanently ceases to carry on a UK 
property business if: 
    &#8226; a company ceases to be within the charge to income tax in respect of the UK 
       property business; or 
 
    &#8226; a company or any other person ceases to be a member of a firm which carries 
       on a UK property business. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="283" SerialNumber="319">Clause 283: Other rules about what counts as a &#8220;post-cessation receipt&#8221; 
1010. This clause brings together signposts to rules that operate so as to treat certain 
sums as post-cessation receipts and to exclude others from the charge. It is new. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 354 of ITTOIA. 
 
1011. Subsection (1) is a signpost to the clause that deals with the transfer of a right 
to receive a post-cessation receipt to a person who does not carry on a UK property 
business. 
 
1012. Subsection (2) lists the trading income rules that apply to create post-cessation 
receipts for the purpose of this Chapter. 
 
1013. Subsection (3) draws attention to the rule in Chapter 5 of this Part that treats a 
sum received as not being a post-cessation receipt if the right to it was transferred 
with a property business. It also mentions the rule in Part 18 of this Bill that treats 
profits of an overseas property business as post-cessation receipts (of a UK property 
business) if they become remittable after the company has ceased to carry on the 
business. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="284" SerialNumber="320">Clause 284: Transfer of rights if transferee does not carry on UK property 
business 
1014. This clause sets out the positions of the transferor and transferee if the right to 
a post-cessation receipt is transferred for value. It is based on section 106 of ICTA, as 
applied by section 21B of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 355 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="285" SerialNumber="321">Clause 285: Allowable deductions 
1015. This clause applies the trading income rules about allowable deductions. It is 
based on section 105 of ICTA, as applied by section 21B of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="286" SerialNumber="322">Clause 286: Election to carry back 
1016. This clause allows a company to elect to have a post-cessation receipt taxed as 
though it had been received in the accounting period in which the company ceased to 
carry on the UK property business. It is based on section 108 of ICTA, as applied by 
section 21B of ICTA, although section 108 was repealed by ITTIOA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 257 of ITTOIA, as applied by 
section 351(2)(b) of ITTOIA. 
 
1017. See Change 42 in Annex 1 and the commentary on clause 198. 

 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="10" SerialNumber="323">Chapter 10: Supplementary 
<Clause Number="287" SerialNumber="324">Clause 287: Provisions which must be given priority over this Part 
1018. This clause provides the rules to determine which Part takes priority in the 
event of any overlap of the charge on the profits of a trade and the charge on the 
profits of an overseas property business or the charge under Chapter 7 or 8 of this 
Part. It is based on sections 18 and 70A of ICTA. 
 
1019. The definitions of Schedule D Cases I and VI are in section 18 of ICTA. 
Those definitions deal with any overlap between a trade and the profits of a UK 
concern or the profits of a UK electric line wayleave. Case VI charges income that is 
not charged under any other case. So this clause gives trading income (Case I in the 
source legislation) priority. 
 
1020. The clause also gives statutory effect to the Crown Option between an 
overseas property business and a United Kingdom trade. See Change 55 in Annex 1. 
The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 261 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="288" SerialNumber="325">Clause 288: Priority between Chapters within this Part

It is based on sections 119 and 120 of ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax 
are in section 262 of ITTOIA. 
 
1022. Subsection (3) deals with income that falls within both Chapter 7 and 
Chapter 8 of this Part. See Change 6 in Annex 1 and the commentary on clause 45. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="289" SerialNumber="326">Clause 289: Effect of company starting or ceasing to be within charge to 
corporation tax 
1023. This clause treats a company as starting or ceasing to carry on a property 
business in particular circumstances. It is based on section 337 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 362 of ITTOIA. 
 
1024. This clause applies when a company moves into or out of the corporation tax 
regime. Non-UK resident companies are within the charge to corporation tax only if 
they are trading, are trading in the United Kingdom, and through a permanent 
establishment in the United Kingdom. Then they are chargeable to corporation tax on 
all the profits attributable to that permanent establishment. If those profits include the 
profits of a property business, first meeting or ceasing to meet those conditions will 
result in a change of taxing regime from income tax to corporation tax or vice versa. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="290" SerialNumber="327">Clause 290: Overseas property businesses and overseas land: adaptation of rules 
1025. This clause sets out how the rules for United Kingdom property businesses are 
to be adapted to apply to overseas property businesses. It is based on section 70A of 
ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 363 of ITTOIA.

</Clause></Chapter></Part><Part Number="5" SerialNumber="329">Part 5: Loan Relationships 
Overview 
1028. This overview deals with Parts 5 and 6. 
 
1029. This and the following Part contain provisions on loan relationships. The 
extent of the legislation merits two Parts. 
 
1030. A company has a loan relationship when it stands in the position of a creditor 
or debtor in respect of a money debt which is a transaction for the lending of money. 
The rules dealing with loan relationships are found in this Part. This Part is based 
mainly on Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 1996, which brings into account for corporation 
tax purposes all gains and losses arising to a company from its loan relationships. 
 
1031. Other arrangements which are treated as loan relationships such as debt which 
does not involve the lending of money, finance arrangements that do not involve the 
payment or receipt of interest, particular share issues, repurchase agreements etc are 
found in Part 6. The source legislation for this Part is sometimes found outside 
FA 1996. 
 
1032. Although the rules for computing the credits and debits on loan relationships 
used for the purposes of a trade are within this Part, the credits are treated as receipts 
and the debits as expenses in computing the trading profits within Part 3 of the Bill. 
Profits on loan relationships that are not used for the purposes of a trade are charged 
under this Part. The charge on such profits is separate from the charge on trading 
profits. 
 
1033. Losses on non-trading loan relationships (where debits exceed credits) are 
relieved against company profits. 
 
1034. Profits on derivative contracts which are not used for the purposes of a trade 
are charged as if they were gains on loan relationships, but the rules for computing 
such profits are to be found in the Part 7 (derivative contracts) of this Bill. Losses on 
such derivatives are also dealt with as if they were losses on a loan relationship. 
 
1035. Provisions on capital gains within the loan relationships provisions have not 
been rewritten in this Part or Part 6 but are inserted into TCGA by Schedule 1. 
 
<Chapter Number="1" SerialNumber="330">Chapter 1: Introduction 
Overview 
1036. This Chapter acts as an introduction to this Part. It sets out the structure of the 
Part and the way in which credits and debits on a loan relationship are brought into 
account in the case of both trading and non-trading loan relationships. 

 
<Clause Number="292" SerialNumber="331">Clause 292: Overview of Part 
1037. This clause provides an overview of the Part. It is new. 
 
1038. Subsection (1) refers only to &#8220;profits&#8221; on a loan relationship and not &#8220;profits 
and gains&#8221; as does the source legislation. This has been followed throughout the Part 
on the ground that only one term is necessary. &#8220;Profits&#8221; has been adopted as being the 
usual taxation term and as making the link to case law on profits for corporation tax 
purposes clearer for the two Parts. 
 
1039. The term &#8220;loan relationship&#8221; has been retained for its familiarity although the 
term is not as appropriate now as it was when the source legislation was enacted 
in 1996. The provisions now apply to a number of relationships which are not &#8220;loans&#8221;. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="293" SerialNumber="332">Clause 293: Construction of references to profits or losses from loan 
relationships 
1040. This clause provides that profits and losses from loan relationships include 
profits and losses from related transactions. It is based on section 84(1) of FA 1996. 
The inclusion of related transactions avoids the repetition of the source legislation 
(&#8220;gains and losses on loan relationships and related transactions, etc&#8221;). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="294" SerialNumber="333">Clause 294: Matters treated as loan relationships 
1041. This clause requires references to this Part of the Bill to include references to 
Part 6 and arises from the decision to spread the loan relationships provisions over 
two Parts of the Bill. It is new. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="295" SerialNumber="334">Clause 295: General rule: profits arising from loan relationships chargeable as 
income

section 80(1) and (3) of FA 1996. See Change 59 in Annex 1 under clause 413 in

</Clause><Clause Number="301" SerialNumber="340">Clause 301: Calculation of non-trading profits and deficits from loan

FA 1996. 
 
1052. Section 81(6) which states that &#8220;money&#8221; includes money expressed in a 
currency other than sterling is unnecessary and has not been rewritten. &#8220;Money&#8221;, in its 
usual meaning, already includes currencies other than sterling.

Overview 
1055. This Chapter provides the rules for bringing profits and deficits on loan 
relationships into account for corporation tax purposes. The provisions in this Chapter 
all represent rules that apply generally rather than to specific types of securities or 
specific types of companies. They have therefore been placed early on in the Part. 
 
<Clause Number="306" SerialNumber="346">Clause 306: Overview of Chapter

debits 
1057. This clause provides the rule that credits and debits are those recognised in 
determining the company&#8217;s profit and loss for a period and must fairly represent 
profits and losses from loan relationships and also gives further rules on allowable 
expenses. It is based on section 84(1) and (3) and 85A(1) of FA 1996. 
 
1058. Subsections (3)(c) and (4) allow certain expenses on loans to be treated as 
debits for the purposes of this Part. 
 
1059. The inclusion of profits of a capital nature in section 84(1)(a) of FA 1996 is 
rewritten in clause 293(3). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="308" SerialNumber="348">Clause 308: Amounts recognised in determining a company&#8217;s profit or loss 
1060. This clause explains what is meant by amounts recognised in determining a 
company&#8217;s profit or loss account for a period. It is based on section 85B(1) and (2) of 
FA 1996. 
 
1061. This clause updates the references in section 85B(1)(a) and (b) of FA 1996 to 
a company&#8217;s statement of income and gains, etc in line with current accountancy 
practice. 
 
1062. Accounting terms appearing more than once are included in clause 476 (other

&#8220;statement of total recognised gains and losses&#8221; as being the usual accountancy term. 
 
1064. &#8220;Generally accepted accounting principles&#8221; appears in the Schedule 4 to this 
Bill. 
 
1065. Part 2(6) of Schedule 11 to F(No 2)A 2005 repeals section 85B(6) of FA 1996 
with effect from a date to be appointed.

section 85A(2) to (4) of FA 1996 and paragraph 14(8) of Schedule 13 to FA 2007. 
 
1067. &#8220;Correct accounts&#8221; in section 85A(2) has been rewritten as &#8220;GAAP-compliant

1069. Part 2(6) of Schedule 11 to F(No 2)A 2005 repeals section 85(6) of FA 1996 
with effect from a day to be appointed. Subsection (5), which rewrites section 85B(6)

(loan relationships) of Schedule 2 to the Bill). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="311" SerialNumber="351">Clause 311: Amounts not fully recognised for accounting purposes: introduction 
1070. This clause sets out the circumstances in which clause 312 applies. It is based 
on section 85C(1) and (2) of FA 1996. This and the following clause apply where, as 
a result of GAAP (generally accepted accounting practice), the full amount arising on 
transactions is not brought into account. This can arise in two circumstances: first 
where assets and liabilities are &#8220;matched&#8221; and GAAP permits the whole or part of the

preceding clause are in point and requires credits and debits arising on transactions 
which are not recognised in determining the company&#8217;s profit or loss to be 
recognised. It is based on section 85C(3) to (8) of FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="313" SerialNumber="353">Clause 313: Basis of accounting: &#8220;amortised cost basis&#8221;, &#8220;fair value accounting&#8221; 
and &#8220;fair value&#8221; 
1072. This clause deals with the accounting bases that may apply to loan 
relationships. It is based on section 85A(1) and section 103(1) of FA 1996. 
 
1073. In general a company may make use of either an amortised cost basis or fair 
value in accounting for loan relationships (both these terms are defined in the clause) 
but certain provisions specify that an amortised cost basis or fair value basis must be 
used. These are listed in subsection (2). 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="314" SerialNumber="354">Clause 314: Power to make regulations about changes from amortised cost basis 
1074. This clause provides the powers for the Treasury to make regulations 
providing for the continued use of an amortised costs basis. It is based on 
section 90A(1) and (2) of FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="315" SerialNumber="355">Clause 315: Introduction to sections 316 to 319 
1075. This clause acts as an introduction to the following four clauses which provide 
the rules to apply where there is a change in accounting policy from one period of 
account to the next. It is based on paragraph 19A(1) and (2) of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. 
 
1076. Although this provision was enacted specifically to deal with companies 
changing from UK GAAP to international accounting standards or vice versa it will 
apply equally to other changes where both policies accord with the law and practice. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="316" SerialNumber="356">Clause 316: Change of accounting policy involving change of value 
1077. This clause requires debits or credits to be brought into account representing 
the difference between the value of the asset or liability at the end of the last period of 
account under the old accounting policy and the beginning of the first period under 
the new accounting policy. It is based on paragraph 19A(3) and (5) of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="317" SerialNumber="357">Clause 317: Carrying value 
1078. This clause gives the meaning of terms used in the previous clause. It is based 
on paragraph 19A(4), (4A) and (4B) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="318" SerialNumber="358">Clause 318: Change of accounting policy following cessation of loan relationship 
1079. This clause provides for debits and credits representing differences in the 
value of assets and liabilities following a change of accounting policy to be brought 
into account where clause 331 (company ceasing to be party to a loan relationship) 
also applies. It is based on paragraph 19A(4C) to (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1080. Sub-paragraph (4C) of paragraph 19A provides for the difference between the 
two values to be brought into account at the beginning of the later period. This is not 
rewritten as it is unnecessary. This brings the clause into line with paragraph 50A(3C) 
of Schedule 26 to FA 2002, the equivalent provision for derivative contracts. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="319" SerialNumber="359">Clause 319: General power to make regulations about changes in accounting 
policy 
1081. This clause gives the Treasury powers to make regulations providing for debits 
and credits to be brought into account or not to be brought into account under this Part 
where a change of accounting policy affects the amounts brought into account for 
accounting purposes. The clause is based on paragraph 19B of Schedule 9 to FA 1996 
and paragraph 52 of Schedule 4 to FA 2005. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="320" SerialNumber="360">Clause 320: Credits and debits treated as relating to capital expenditure 
1082. This is the first of several clauses which require debits and credits to be 
brought into, or not brought into, account for the purposes of this Part where normal 
accounting treatment is not followed. It is based on paragraph 14 of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. This clause provides that a credit or debit which has been capitalised but 
which is in respect of a loan relationship is, in certain circumstances, to be brought 
into account. 
 
1083. The words &#8220;for the purposes of corporation tax&#8221; in paragraph 14(2) have been 
rewritten in subsection (2) more narrowly as &#8220;for the purposes of this Part&#8221;, the wider 
purpose being unnecessary in this context. 
 
1084. In subsection (6) &#8220;the interest component of the asset&#8221; is the interest element 
capitalised with the relevant asset. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="321" SerialNumber="361">Clause 321: Credits and debits recognised in equity 
1085. This clause provides that credits and debits on loan relationships taken directly 
to reserves should be brought into account as if they were taken to the profit and loss 
account. It is based on paragraph 14A of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="322" SerialNumber="362">Clause 322: Release of debts: cases where credits not required to be brought into 
account 
1086. This clause provides that credits are not brought into account by a debtor 
company on the release of the debt when an amortised cost basis is used and certain 
conditions are met. It is based on paragraph 5(3), (4), (7) and (8) of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. 
 
1087. Conditions 2 and 3 of paragraph 5 of Schedule 9 to FA 1996 apply only where 
the debtor and creditor companies are connected and are rewritten in clauses 358 
and 359 in Chapter 6 of this Part (connected companies relationships: impairment 
losses and releases of debts). 
 
1088. Subsection (6) lists the insolvency conditions from paragraph 6A(1) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996 rather than cross-referring as does paragraph 5(7). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="323" SerialNumber="363">Clause 323: Meaning of expressions relating to insolvency etc 
1089. This clause gives the meaning of various terms relevant to the preceding 
clause. It is based on paragraphs 5(7) and 6A(3) to (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1090. References to Northern Ireland legislation in this clause have been updated to 
take into account amendments made by the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 
(SI 2005/1455 (NI10)). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="324" SerialNumber="364">Clause 324: Restriction on debits resulting from revaluation 
1091. This clause precludes debits from being brought into account on revaluation of 
assets representing creditor relationships for the purposes of this Part (other than 
impairment losses or debt releases on the revaluation of asset) unless under fair value 
accounting. It is based on paragraph 6D(1) and (3) to (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="325" SerialNumber="365">Clause 325: Restriction on credits resulting from reversal of disallowed debits 
1092. This clause provides that the reversal of debits disallowed under the previous 
clause are not brought into account under this Part. It is based on paragraph 6D(2) 
and (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="326" SerialNumber="366">Clause 326: Writing off government investments 
1093. This clause provides that no credit need be brought into account where the 
government releases a liability on a government debt. It is based on paragraph 7 of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="327" SerialNumber="367">Clause 327: Disallowance of imported losses etc 
1094. This clause ensures that no part of a loss on a loan relationship is brought into 
account if it arose at a time when the loan relationship was not subject to United 
Kingdom taxation. It is based on paragraph 10 of FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="328" SerialNumber="368">Clause 328: Exchange gains and losses 
1095. This clause includes exchange gains and losses within credits and debits on 
loan relationships. It is based on section 84A(1) to (3A) and (8) to (10) of FA 1996. 
 
1096. This clause updates the references in section 84A(3)(b) of FA 1996 in line 
with current accountancy practice. 
 
1097. Subsection (3)(b) rewrites &#8220;statement of recognised gains and losses&#8221; as 
&#8220;statement of total recognised gains and losses&#8221; as being the usual accountancy term. 
 
1098. Section 84A(8) of FA 1996 as it applies to chargeable gains 
(section 84A(9)(b)) is rewritten as an insertion into TCGA. See Schedule 1 to this 
Bill. 
 
1099. Part 2(6) of Schedule 11 to F(No 2)A 2005 repeals section 84A of FA 1996 
with effect from a day to be appointed. This clause, which rewrites that section, 
therefore ceases to have effect from an appointed day (see Schedule 2 to this Bill). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="329" SerialNumber="369">Clause 329: Pre-loan relationship and abortive expenses 
1100. This clause allows abortive expenditure in connection with a loan relationship.

1101. This clause provides for an election to be made for non-trading debits incurred 
before the commencement of a trade to be treated as trading debits after that trade has 
commenced. It is based on section 401(1AB) and (1AC) of ICTA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="331" SerialNumber="371">Clause 331: Company ceasing to be party to loan relationship 
1102. This clause provides for debits and credits to be taken into account in respect 
of a loan relationship to which a company is no longer a party if those debits and

relationship the company must bring those amounts into account. It is based on 
paragraph 15 of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="333" SerialNumber="373">Clause 333: Company ceasing to be UK resident 
1104. This clause provides that a company ceasing to be resident in the United 
Kingdom is treated as disposing of assets and liabilities which represent loan 
relationships at fair value unless they are held or owed by a permanent establishment 
in the United Kingdom. It is based on paragraph 10A(1) to (3) of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996.

held or owed by a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom other than as a 
result of a disposal etc. It is based on paragraph 10A(1), (1A) and (4) of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="4" SerialNumber="375">Chapter 4: Continuity of treatment on transfers within groups or on 
reorganisations 
Overview 
1106. This Chapter sets out what happens when a loan relationship is transferred 
between members of a group and on a reorganisation. 
 
<Clause Number="335" SerialNumber="376">Clause 335: Introduction to Chapter 
1107. This clause acts as an introduction by setting out the three cases under which 
the continuity of treatment provisions in the Chapter apply and explaining how the 
Chapter is organised. It is based on paragraphs 12(1) and (8) and 12G(1) and (4) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="336" SerialNumber="377">Clause 336: Transfers of loans on group transactions 
1108. This clause specifies the transfers within the first case in clause 335(1) where 
the continuity rules of the Chapter apply &#8211; transfers between group members. It is 
based on paragraph 12(1) and (3) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="337" SerialNumber="378">Clause 337: Transfers of loans on insurance business transfers 
80      This clause specifies the transfer within the second case in clause 335(1) 
where the continuity rules of the Chapter apply. It is based on paragraph 12(1), (4) 
and (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
81     In subsection (6)(b) &#8220;corresponding category&#8221; means the category of asset in 
section 440(4) of ICTA as modified by regulation 11(3) of The Overseas Life 
Insurance Companies Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/3271). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="338" SerialNumber="379">Clause 338: Meaning of company replacing another as party to loan relationship 
1109. This clause explains what is meant by one party replacing the other as a party 
to a loan relationship for the purposes of clause 335. It is based on paragraph 12(6) 
to (7A) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1110. Subsections (3) and (4) deal with the position where a company replaces 
another company as a creditor and subsections (5) and (6) where it replaces the other 
company as a debtor. The debtor rules will apply where a company has borrowed 
money but substitutes another group company as the debtor by novating the debt. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="339" SerialNumber="380">Clause 339: Issues of new securities on certain cross-border reorganisations 
1111. This clause sets out the third case in clause 335(1) where the continuity rules 
of the Chapter apply. This case is where section 135(3) of TCGA (exchange of 
securities for those in another company) applies (or would do but for section 116(5) of 
that Act) and certain conditions are met. It is based on paragraphs 12G(1), (3) and (6) 
and 12J(2) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="340" SerialNumber="381">Clause 340: Group transfers and transfers of insurance business: transfer at 
notional carrying value 
1112. Under this clause any gain or loss is disregarded where, as a result of a 
transaction or series of transactions referred to in clause 335(1)(a) and (b) 335, one 
company replaces another as a party to a loan relationship. It is based on 
paragraph 12(1), (2ZA), (2), (2C) and (9) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. The clause 
provides that the transaction or series of transactions take place at book value 
(&#8220;carrying value&#8221;). 
 
1113. The rules in this clause regarding the bringing into account of debits and 
credits apply only where the company being replaced as party to the loan relationship 
accounts for the relationship under the amortised cost basis. Clause 341 provides rules 
for where the company being replaced as a party to the loan relationship uses fair 
value accounting. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="341" SerialNumber="382">Clause 341: Transferor using fair value accounting 
1114. This clause applies where the company making the transfer under clause 340 
uses fair value accounting as respects the loan relationship or the debits and credits to 
be brought into account rather than the amortised cost basis. It is based on 12(2A) 
to (2C) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
1115. The company which is being replaced as a party to the loan relationship brings 
in the asset or liability at fair value. The company becoming a party to the loan 
relationship is treated as acquiring the asset or liability for the same value it has in the 
accounts of the company being replaced. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="342" SerialNumber="383">Clause 342: Issues of new securities on reorganisations: disposal at notional 
carrying value 
1116. This clause provides that where clause 339 applies (the third case in 
clause 335(1)), debits and credits are to be brought into account as if there were a 
disposal of the loan relationship at its carrying value in the accounts. It is based on 
clause 12G(1) and (3) to (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="343" SerialNumber="384">Clause 343: Receiving company using fair value accounting 
1117. This clause provides the rule to apply in place of the rule in clause 342 where 
fair value accounting is used by the company to which the issue of shares or 
debentures is made. It is based on paragraph 12G(5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996 (which 
applies paragraph 12(2A) of that Schedule). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="344" SerialNumber="385">Clause 344: Introduction 
1118. This clause introduces the two following clauses and provides that they apply 
where a company leaves a group within six years and an asset or liability was 
transferred to that company in circumstances where clause 340 applies. It is based on 
paragraph 12A(1), (5), (5A) and (8) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="345" SerialNumber="386">Clause 345: Transferee leaving group otherwise than because of exempt 
distribution 
1119. This clause provides the first of the degrouping rules: where a company ceases 
to be a member of a group otherwise than as a result of an exempt distribution under 
section 213(2) of ICTA. It is based on paragraph 12A(1) to (5) and (9) of Schedule 9 
to FA 1996. Because section 213 of ICTA is designed to facilitate demergers, there is 
no degrouping charge where that section applies to exempt a distribution of the 
company&#8217;s shares. This clause deems there to have been a disposal and reacquisition 
at market value just before the company leaves the group and any resulting credit 
must be brought into account. 
 
1120. Subsection (4) is designed to ensure parity of treatment between a loan 
relationship and a derivative contract that is being used to hedge it. The effect is to 
allow a debit on the loan relationship on deemed disposal if a credit is brought into 
account on the derivative contract. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="346" SerialNumber="387">Clause 346: Transferee leaving group because of exempt distribution 
1121. This clause applies to bring in a charge, in certain circumstances, where one 
group member replaces another group member as a party to a loan relationship and 
ceases to be a group member as a result of an exempt distribution under 
section 213(2) of ICTA. It is based on paragraph 12A(3) to (9) of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. 
1122. Where a company exploits a demerger for avoidance purposes by transferring 
within a five year period funds or assets to its members, a chargeable payment arises 
under section 214(2) of ICTA. Where such chargeable payments are made this clause 
treats the company as disposing of, and immediately reacquiring, the loan relationship 
at fair value when the chargeable payment is made. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="347" SerialNumber="388">Clause 347: Disapplication of Chapter where transferor party to avoidance 
1123. This clause applies where an asset or liability is likely to be transferred by the 
transferee company and the continuity provisions applying for clauses 336 and 337 
would otherwise apply. It is based on paragraph 12(2D) to (2F) of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. Where the transfer is under arrangements to which the transferor company 
is a party and the intention is to avoid tax, the continuity provisions of this Chapter 
which would otherwise apply do not. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="5" SerialNumber="389">Chapter 5: Connected companies relationships: introduction and general 
Overview 
1124. Connected companies loan relationships are subject to special rules under this 
Part. The Chapter explains what is meant by such a relationship, the accounting rules 
to apply to that relationship and what happens when a company begins or ceases to be 
a connected company. 
 
<Clause Number="348" SerialNumber="390">Clause 348: Introduction: meaning of &#8220;connected companies relationship&#8221; 
1125. This clause provides the meaning of &#8220;connected companies relationship&#8221;. It is 
based on section 87(1), (3) and (5) of FA 1996. 
 
1126. &#8220;Person&#8221; in section 87(1), (3) and (5) of FA 1996 has been rewritten as 
&#8220;company&#8221;. See Change 56 in Annex 1. 
 
1127. Section 87(5) deals with intermediaries between two connected companies 
through which a loan is &#8220;dog-legged&#8221;. Such intermediaries may be individuals. This 
has been rewritten in this clause by treating debtor and creditor relationships 
separately. Paragraph (b) of subsections (2) and (4) is necessary because loans 
between individuals do not fall into the definition of a loan relationship in 
section 81(1) of FA 1996. 
 
1128. Subsection (6) brings out more clearly than in the source legislation 
(section 87(3) of FA 1996) that where there is a connection at any time in an 
accounting period there is a connected companies relationship for the whole of the 
period. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="349" SerialNumber="391">Clause 349: Application of amortised cost basis to connected companies 
relationships 
1129. This clause provides that where a loan relationship is a &#8220;connected companies 
relationship&#8221; (the parties to a loan relationship are connected) both parties must use 
the same basis of accounting &#8211; the amortised cost basis rather than the fair value basis. 
It is based on section 87(1) and (2) of FA 1996. The same basis of accounting ensures 
both that the value of the loan cannot be artificially depressed and that debits in the 
one company are matched by credits in the other. 
 
1130. In subsection (2) &#8220;for the period&#8221; has been added for clarification. The words 
do not appear in section 87(2) which this subsection rewrites. 
 
1131. Subsection (3) makes the requirement for amortised cost basis subject to 
clause 454 (reset bonds) which requires fair value accounting to apply. See Change 57 
in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="350" SerialNumber="392">Clause 350: Companies beginning to be connected 
1132. This clause provides the rule to be applied when companies begin to be 
connected under clause 348 and this involves a change in accounting basis from fair 
value accounting to the amortised cost basis. It is based on section 87(2A) and (2B) of 
FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="351" SerialNumber="393">Clause 351: Companies ceasing to be connected 
1133. This clause provides the rule to be applied when companies cease to be 
connected under clause 348 and this involves a change in accounting basis from the

of FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="352" SerialNumber="394">Clause 352: Disregard of related transactions 
1134. This clause provides that credits and debits in respect of related transactions 
are only brought into account where they do not create greater deductions or smaller 
credits than would have been the case if the transactions had not taken place. The 
clause is based on paragraph 6(1), (2) and (6) to (8) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="6" SerialNumber="395">Chapter 6: Connected companies relationships: impairment losses and releases 
of debts 
Overview 
1135. This Chapter provides rules for impairment losses and release of debt where 
there is a connection between the debtor and creditor companies. 
 
1136. Paragraph 5ZA of Schedule 9 to FA 1996 requires paragraphs 6, 6A and 6C of 
that Schedule to apply in relation to a debit in respect of the release of a liability as 
they apply in relation to an impairment loss. In rewriting these paragraphs references 
to a debt on the release of a liability (referred to here as a &#8220;release debit&#8221;) have been 
inserted into the relevant clauses. 
 
<Clause Number="353" SerialNumber="396">Clause 353: Introduction to Chapter 
1137. This clause explains the subject and layout of the Chapter and provides some 
definitions. It is based on section 87(3) of, and paragraphs 4A(8), 5ZA and 6C(1) of 
Schedule 9 to, FA 1996. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="354" SerialNumber="397">Clause 354: Exclusion of debits for impaired or released connected companies 
debts 
1138. This clause provides the basic rule that neither impairment losses nor debits 
arising as a result of the release of liability under a creditor relationship (&#8220;release 
debits&#8221;) are brought into account if the debtor and creditor company are connected. It 
is based on paragraph 6(1) to (3) and (8) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="355" SerialNumber="398">Clause 355: Cessation of connection 
1139. This clause provides that debits for impairment losses or release debits which 
are not brought into account under the preceding clause are not to be brought into 
account in subsequent accounting periods after connection ceases. It is based on 
paragraph 6C(1) and (3) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1140. Paragraph 6C(3) of Schedule 9 refers to a &#8220;debit &#8230;. in respect of an amount&#8221; 
although there is now no preceding reference in the paragraph to an amount. This 
reference was not repealed following an amendment by FA 2002. Sub-paragraph (1) 
previously read: 
 
     (1) Where, in the case of a creditor relationship of a company,- 
     (a) a departure that would otherwise have been allowed under paragraph 5(1) above in respect of 
     an amount is or was, by virtue of paragraph 6 above, not allowed in the case of an accounting 
     period; and

     of this Act, no connection between the company and any person standing in the position of a 
     debtor as respects the debt, 
     sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) below shall apply. 
1141. The paragraph has been rewritten to reflect the fact that &#8220;the amount&#8221; refers to 
the impairment loss (or release debit by virtue of paragraph 5ZA of Schedule 9). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="356" SerialNumber="399">Clause 356: Exception to section 354: swapping debt for equity 
1142. This clause provides the first of two exceptions to the basic rule in clause 354. 
It is based on paragraph 6(4) and (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. The exception in this 
clause applies when the liability is released in consideration for shares in the debtor 
company which give rise to the connection. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="357" SerialNumber="400">Clause 357: Exception to section 354: insolvent creditors 
1143. This clause provides the second exception to the basic rule in clause 354. It is 
based on paragraph 6A(1) and (2) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. The exception in this 
clause applies where the creditor is in insolvent liquidation, etc and the impairment 
loss or release debit accrues during the winding up, etc. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="358" SerialNumber="401">Clause 358: Exclusion of credits on release of connected companies debts: 
general 
1144. This clause precludes a debtor company from bringing a credit into account 
under this Part on the release of a debt where the debtor and creditor companies are 
connected. It is based on paragraph 5(3) and (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. This 
clause excludes the credits on the release since the debits have been disallowed (see 
clause 354). 
 
1145. Subsection (1)(b) brings out the fact that the clause applies in respect of the 
accounting period in which the release occurs. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="359" SerialNumber="402">Clause 359: Exclusion of credits on release of connected companies debts during 
creditor&#8217;s insolvency 
1146. This clause precludes a debtor company from bringing a credit into account on 
the release of a debt where the creditor company meets the insolvency, etc conditions 
in clause 357 if the insolvency, etc breaks the connected company relationship. It is 
based on paragraph 5(3) and (6) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1147. Subsection (1)(d) and (e) reflect the rule in section 12(7) and (7ZA) of ICTA 
that an accounting period ends with insolvency or administration. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="360" SerialNumber="403">Clause 360: Exclusion of credits on reversal of impairments of connected 
companies debts 
1148. This clause provides that the credit on a reversed impairment loss is not 
brought into account under this Part where that loss is not brought into account under 
clause 354. It is based on paragraph 6(3A) and (8) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="361" SerialNumber="404">Clause 361: Acquisition of creditor rights by connected company at undervalue 
1149. This clause applies where a company acquires a debt from a third party as a 
result of which it becomes connected to the debtor. The clause is based on 
paragraph 4A of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. If the pre-acquisition value of the debt 
exceeds the consideration, the difference is treated as a release by the acquiring 
company and hence a charge on the debtor company. 
 
1150. Under paragraph 4A(2)(d) the provisions of that paragraph do not apply where 
the new creditor acquires the debt from a connected person. &#8220;Person&#8221; has been 
rewritten in subsection (1)(d) to apply to a company only. See Change 56 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="362" SerialNumber="405">Clause 362: Parties becoming connected where creditor&#8217;s rights subject to 
impairment adjustment 
1151. Under this clause where a debtor company and a creditor company become 
connected, any reduction in the value of the debt as a result of an impairment loss 
which was not yet reflected in the book value of the debt at the time of acquisition is 
treated as a release by the creditor. It is based on paragraph 4A(1), (4), (5), (7) 
and (10) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="363" SerialNumber="406">Clause 363: Companies connected for sections 361 and 362 
1152. This clause explains what is meant by connected companies for the purposes 
of the two preceding clauses. It is based on paragraph 4A(8) and (9) of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. 
1153. This definition differs from the definition for connectedness in clause 466 by 
its application to periods of account rather than accounting periods. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="7" SerialNumber="407">Chapter 7: Group relief claims involving impaired or released consortium debts 
Overview 
1154. This Chapter provides rules to prevent both a claim to group relief surrendered 
by a consortium company and debits for impairment losses on loans made to the 
consortium company. The purpose of these rather complex provisions is to prevent a 
claim to &#8220;double relief&#8221;, ie in respect of both an impairment loss for the consortium 
member and a group relief claim surrendered by the consortium company. This 
situation would not arise in the case of companies within a group as a result of the rule 
in clause 354 which disallows impairment losses if the debtor and creditor companies 
are connected. 
 
1155. Paragraph 5ZA of Schedule 9 to FA 1996 applies paragraph 5A, on which this 
Chapter is based, in relation to a debit in respect of the release of a liability as it 
applies in relation to an impairment loss. In rewriting these paragraphs in this Chapter 
references to a debit on the release of a liability (referred to here as a &#8220;release debit&#8221;) 
have been inserted into the relevant clauses. 
 
<Clause Number="364" SerialNumber="408">Clause 364: Introduction to Chapter 
1156. This clause sets out the general circumstances when the provisions of the 
Chapter will apply, what the Chapter does and, in subsection (2), provides an 
important definition. It is based on paragraphs 5ZA and 5A(1) to (4) and (16) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="365" SerialNumber="409">Clause 365: Reduction of impairment loss debits where group relief claimed 
1157. This clause provides the basic rule: where group relief is surrendered to a 
consortium member (or a member&#8217;s group company) by the consortium company and 
there is an excess of impairment losses over credits arising on loans to the consortium 
company, those impairment losses are reduced by the group relief claimed. It is based 
on paragraphs 5ZA and 5A(5) to (7) and (19) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="366" SerialNumber="410">Clause 366: Effect where credit for release brought into account on amortised 
cost basis 
1158. This clause provides that where a consortium company brings in a credit on an 
amortised cost basis on the release of a liability by a consortium member and that 
member debits an equal amount, the debit is not taken into account under this 
Chapter. It is based in paragraph 5A(15) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="367" SerialNumber="411">Clause 367: Reduction of credits exceeding impairment losses 
1159. This clause provides that where credits on loan relationships between the 
consortium member (or group company) and the consortium company exceed debits 
on those loans, the credits are reduced by debits previously reduced under clause 365. 
It is based on paragraph 5A(8) to (10) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. The reduction 
compensates for the restrictions in an earlier period which would not have arisen had 
there not, in that period, been an excess of debits over credits. 
 
1160. Paragraph 5A(8)(a) of Schedule 9 refers to related debt recovery credits 
brought into account &#8220;under paragraph 5 above&#8221;. This is an incorrect reference and 
was overlooked in the consequential amendments to FA 2004 which removed 
paragraph 5(1) to (2A) of Schedule 9. This has been rewritten as if referring to the 
amounts brought into account in computing the &#8220;relevant net debits&#8221; (see 
paragraph 5A(5)(b)), which is the obvious meaning. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="368" SerialNumber="412">Clause 368: Reduction of claims where there are earlier net consortium debits 
1161. This clause provides that claims for group relief surrendered by the consortium 
company to a consortium member (or group company) are reduced by the excess of 
debits over credits on loans to the consortium company in preceding years. It is based 
on paragraph 5A(11) to (13) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="369" SerialNumber="413">Clause 369: Carry forward of claims where there are no net consortium debits 
1162. This clause applies where there is a claim for group relief by a consortium 
company (or group member) but no net debit in respect of debts with the consortium 
company. It is based on paragraph 5A(14) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. In these 
circumstances the group relief claim is carried forward and treated as increasing a 
group relief claim for the subsequent accounting period for the purposes of 
clause 365.

1167. This clause sets out the basic rule: where interest is not paid within 12 months 
after the end of the accounting period and corresponding credits are not brought into 
account the interest is allowed on a paid rather than an accruals basis where one of the 
circumstances set out in the following clauses applies. It is based on 
paragraph (1), (2) and (6) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="374" SerialNumber="419">Clause 374: Connection between debtor and person standing in position of 
creditor 
1168. This clause gives the first circumstance when clause 373 applies and this is 
where the debtor and creditor companies are connected under clause 466. It is based 
on paragraph 2(1A) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="375" SerialNumber="420">Clause 375: Loans to close companies by participators etc 
1169. This clause gives the second circumstance when clause 373 applies: where the 
company making the loan is a close company (other than a CIS-based close company

1171. This clause gives the third condition when clause 373 applies: where either the

on paragraph 2(1C) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="378" SerialNumber="423">Clause 378: Loans by trustees of occupational pension schemes 
1172. This clause gives the fourth and final condition when clause 373 applies:

of the members is a company. 

 
<Clause Number="380" SerialNumber="426">Clause 380: Partnerships involving companies 
1175. This clause gives the basic rule for computing the debits and credits where a 
money debt is owed by or to a partnership in which one or more of the members is a 
company. It is based on paragraph 19(1) and (2) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1176. &#8220;Profession&#8221; in paragraph 19(1)(a) has not been rewritten on the grounds that 
a company cannot carry on a profession for corporation tax purposes either as a 
partner or otherwise. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="381" SerialNumber="427">Clause 381: Determinations of credits and debits by company partners: general 
1177. This clause expands on the basic rule given in subsection (3) of the previous 
clause. It is based on paragraph 19(3) to (6) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. Each company 
partner is treated as owing or being owed the debt and the credits and debits in 
relation to those debts are treated as those of the company partner in its profit-sharing 
ratio. 
 
1178. &#8220;Gross&#8221; in paragraph 19(5) and (6) of Schedule 9 means that the total credits 
and debits are calculated notwithstanding that the debt is treated as owed to or by each 
company partner and this is brought out in subsection (5). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="382" SerialNumber="428">Clause 382: Company partners using fair value accounting 
1179. This clause provides that company partners using fair value accounting must 
bring debits and credits into account on the same basis. It is based on 
paragraph 19(11) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. Without this provision it might be 
assumed that the deeming required by this Chapter did not require a company to adopt 
its normal accounting method. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="383" SerialNumber="429">Clause 383: Lending between partners and the partnership 
1180. This clause provides the rules for determining whether a company partner 
controls a partnership in circumstances where a money debt exists between the 
partnership and a company partner. It is based on paragraph 19(7) to (9) and (14) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996. If there is such a money debt the rule in clause 349 applies 
under which debits and credits on a loan relationship are determined under the 
amortised cost basis. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="384" SerialNumber="430">Clause 384: Treatment of exchange gains and losses 
1181. This clause disapplies, in certain circumstances, the rule on exchange gains 
and losses in clause 328 which disallows a credit or debit on an exchange gain or loss 
which is taken directly to a company&#8217;s reserves. It is based on paragraph 19(12) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996. Only where the exchange gain or loss by-passes the 
partnership&#8217;s profit and loss account will that clause apply. 
 
1182. The words &#8220;subsection (3) of section 84A of this Act does not apply &#8230;. except 
to the extent that &#8230;.. exchange gains and losses are recognised&#8221; in paragraph 19(12) 
of Schedule 9 to FA 1996 are rewritten to clarify the meaning that the clause rewriting 
section 84A(3) applies so far as the exchange gains and losses` are recognised rather 
than the possible meaning that the clause applies only if they are recognised.

FA 1996 to a company&#8217;s statement of income and gains, etc in line with current 
accountancy practice. 
 
1184. Part 2(6) of Schedule 11 to F(No 2)A 2005 repeals paragraph 19(12) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996 with effect from a day to be appointed. This clause, which 
rewrites that sub-paragraph, will therefore cease to have effect from an appointed day 
(see Part 8 (loan relationships) of Schedule 2 to the Bill).

were held by each company partner in its profit-sharing ratio. It is based on 
paragraph 19(13) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1186. Subsection (3)(b) adopts the language (&#8220;in accordance with the firm&#8217;s profit-

1190. This clause gives the basic rule on set-off. It is based on paragraph 4(2) of 
Schedule 11 to FA 1996. 
 
1191. Subsection (1) requires the deficit to be offset first against any income and 
gains relating to basic life assurance and general annuity business of the deficit 
period. This avoids the necessity of a claim. See Change 58 in Annex 1. 
1192. Paragraph 4(2)(a) of Schedule 11 requires the deficit to be set off to be against 
any income or gains of the deficit period referable to basic life assurance and general 
annuity business and arising or accruing otherwise than in respect of loan 
relationships. The words &#8220;arising or accruing otherwise than in respect of loan 
relationships&#8221; have not been rewritten. If a company has such income and gains they 
must be other than in respect of loan relationships since, by definition, the company 
has a loan relationship deficit and no non-trading income and gains on its loan 
relationships.

Overview 
1209. This Chapter brings together a number of loan relationship rules from within 
and outside Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 1996 on particular types of securities. 
 
1210. Section 96 of FA 1996, which one might expect to be rewritten here, is not. 
That section prevents any rise in capital value of certain gilts from being brought into 
charge as credits on a loan relationship. The two gilts identified in the section are 
expressly protected from a capital gains charge and it was considered improper that a 
charge should arise on changes in capital value under the loan relationships 
legislation. Therefore the interest component only in any credit is taxed.

clause 476(1)) adopts the definition of &#8220;gilt-edged security&#8221; in Schedule 9 to TCGA. 
Paragraph 1A of that Schedule brings strips within the definition of a gilt and 
subsection (1)(b) of this clause reflects this by referring to any other gilt-edged 
security. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="402" SerialNumber="451">Clause 402: Market value of securities 
1217. This clause explains what is meant by the market value of a security in 
clause 401 and gives the Treasury power to amend that meaning. It is based on 
section 95(4) to (6) of FA 1996. 
 
1218. Subsection (3) allows orders to be made for &#8220;such incidental, supplemental, 
consequential and transitional provision and savings&#8221;. This is a standard formulation 
in this Bill for the additional amendments that can be introduced under an order and 
regulation-making power. It is not considered a change in the law. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="403" SerialNumber="452">Clause 403: Meaning of &#8220;strip&#8221; 
1219. This clause gives the meaning of &#8220;strip&#8221; for this Chapter, rewriting in full the 
definition from FA 1942 instead of relying on a cross-reference to that section as does 
section 95(7) of FA 1996. It is based on section 47 of FA 1942 and section 95(7) of 
FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="404" SerialNumber="453">Clause 404: Restriction on deductions etc relating to FOTRA securities 
1220. This clause prevents debits arising on FOTRA securities where the profits are 
exempt under clause 1279. It is based on section 154(6) and (8) of FA 1996 and 
section 161(1), (4) and (7) of FA 1998. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="405" SerialNumber="454">Clause 405: Certain non-UK residents with interest on 3&#189;% War Loan 1952 Or 
After 
1221. This clause restricts a debit for borrowing costs where a non-UK resident 
company holds 3&#189;% War Loan for use in a business of banking, insurance or dealing 
in securities. It is based on section 475 of ICTA. Interest on 3&#189;% War Loan is paid 
without deduction of tax and is exempt in the hands of a non-UK resident company. 
Because a company may borrow to acquire these securities an allowable debit may 
arise on the cost of the borrowing but without giving rise to a taxable credit. 
Consequently the appropriate proportion of the costs of borrowing is disallowed as a 
loan relationships debit. 
 
1222. Step 2 in subsection (3) makes reference only to &#8220;interest which is not brought 
into account &#8230; under this Part&#8221; (although section 475(2) and (4) of ICTA might be 
read as comprising other interest for corporation tax purposes) since interest can only 
be brought into account under loan relationships rules as a result of 
section 337A(2)(a) of ICTA. 
 
1223. Subsections (1), (3) and (4) rewrite &#8220;3&#189;% War Loan 1952 or after&#8221; as &#8220;3&#189;% 
War Loan 1952 Or After&#8221; to prevent the reader attaching the words &#8220;or after&#8221; to any 
following words, thereby adopting the solution used in section 154(8)(b) of FA 1996. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="406" SerialNumber="455">Clause 406: Introduction 
1224. This clause introduces the following six clauses which all deal with deeply 
discounted securities. It is based on paragraphs 17(3) and (4) and 18(2B) and (3) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="407" SerialNumber="456">Clause 407: Postponement until redemption of debits for connected companies&#8217; 
deeply discounted securities 
1225. This clause provides that debits on a deeply discounted security are, in certain 
circumstances, only brought into account under this Part on redemption where the 
debtor and creditor are connected. It is based on paragraph 17(1) to (3) and (5) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996.

discounted securities 
1227. This clause provides that debits on a deeply discounted security can only be 
brought into account under this Part on redemption if the creditor is a participator, etc 
in the debtor company. It is based on paragraph 18(1) to (2B) of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="410" SerialNumber="459">Clause 410: Exceptions to section 409 
1228. This clause provides exceptions to the preceding clause, where either credits 
equalling debits are brought into account under this Part or where the debtor company 
is a CIS-based close company or a CIS limited partnership. It is based on 
paragraph 18(1ZA) to (1C) and (4) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1229. &#8220;The debtor company&#8221; in paragraph 18(1C)(c) of Schedule 9 has been 
rewritten for consistency in subsection (4) as &#8220;the issuing company&#8221;, the term used 
elsewhere in that paragraph. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="411" SerialNumber="460">Clause 411: Interpretation of section 409 
1230. This clause provides definitions and deals with other matters necessary to 
interpret clause 409. It is based on paragraph 18(3B) to (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996.

1231. This clause enables clauses 407 and 409 to apply where there is a series of 
loan relationships or money debts between the company issuing the deeply discounted 
security and the person in the creditor relationship. It is based on paragraphs 17(8) 
and (8A) and 18(2C) and (2D) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1232. Paragraph 18(2D) of Schedule 9 refers to the term &#8220;corresponding creditor 
relationship&#8221; in sub-paragraph (1A)(c). That sub-paragraph was repealed by FA 2002. 
The reference to paragraph (1A)(c) has been rewritten as if it referred to sub- 
paragraph (1A)(b), the sub-paragraph containing the reference to the person standing 
in the position of a creditor. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="413" SerialNumber="462">Clause 413: Issue of funding bonds 
1233. This clause treats issues of funding bonds as interest payments. It is based on 
section 582(1) and (3) to (4) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 380 of ITTOIA. 
 
1234. Subsection (2) rewrites, for clarification, &#8220;value of the bonds at the time of 
their issue&#8221; in section 582(1)(a) as &#8220;market value of the bonds at their issue&#8221;. 
 
1235. For the rewrite of the Schedule D Case VI charge in section 582(2A) of ICTA 
see Change 59 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="414" SerialNumber="463">Clause 414: Redemption of funding bonds 
1236. This clause prevents repayments of funding bonds from being a payment of 
interest if the issue was treated as such in the hands of an individual or company. It is 
based on section 582(1) and (4) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 754 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="415" SerialNumber="464">Clause 415: Loan relationships with embedded derivatives 
1237. Where GAAP requires separate treatment of a loan relationship and its 
embedded derivative, this clause enables the loan relationship to be treated separately 
for the purposes of this Part also. It is based on section 94A(1) and (2) of FA 1996. 
 
1238. Clause 585 in Part 7 (derivative contracts) rewrites as much of section 94A of 
FA 1996 as deals with the treatment of embedded derivatives under Schedule 26 to 
FA 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="416" SerialNumber="465">Clause 416: Election for application of sections 415 and 585 
1239. This clause permits a company subject to old UK GAAP to make an election 
to apply the treatment allowed under clause 415 even though separate treatment of 
loan relationship and derivative does not apply under that accounting policy. It is 
based on paragraph 7(1), (1A), (3), (4), (6) and (7) of Schedule 6 to F(No 2)A 2005.

</Clause><Clause Number="418" SerialNumber="467">Clause 418: Loan relationships treated differently by connected debtor and 
creditor 
1241. This clause applies where connected companies are debtor and creditor to a 
loan relationship which is treated as bifurcated by the debtor but not by the creditor. It 
is based on section 94B(1) to (6) of FA 1996. Where the debits brought into account 
by the debtor exceed the credits brought into account by the creditor additional credits 
must be brought into account by the creditor.

cost basis which are affected by options after the end of the accounting period. It is 
based on paragraph 3(1) and (2) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. The debits and credits to 
be brought into account under this Part are those which would arise if the option were 
exercised in the way most favourable to the party to the loan relationship.

applies, credits and debits on loan relationships which are transferred as part of the

the loan relationships had been transferred at the carrying value in the accounts of the 
transferor. It is based on paragraph 12D(1), (2) and (6) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1248. The definition of &#8220;notional carrying value&#8221; is taken from paragraph 12(2) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996.

1249. This clause provides the rule to apply in place of clause 422 where the 
transferor company uses fair value accounting. It is based on paragraph 12D(7) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996 (which applies paragraph 12(2A) of that Schedule).

1258. The last two words of paragraph 12H(2)(b) (&#8220;paragraph 12G does not apply in

Overview 
This Chapter brings together provisions which counter avoidance, including 
avoidance which arises because transactions are not at arm&#8217;s length. 
 
<Clause Number="440" SerialNumber="492">Clause 440: Overview of Chapter 
1272. This clause explains what the Chapter is about and the provisions it contains. 
It is new. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="441" SerialNumber="493">Clause 441: Loan relationships for unallowable purposes 
1273. This clause prevents a company from bringing into account debits in respect of 
a loan relationship with an &#8220;unallowable purpose&#8221; (defined in the following clause) or 
exchange gains on such a loan relationship. It is based on paragraph 13(1) and (1A) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996. Once such debits or credits are disallowed they are not 
brought into account for any other tax purposes. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="442" SerialNumber="494">Clause 442: Meaning of &#8220;unallowable purpose&#8221; 
1274. This clause gives the meaning of &#8220;unallowable purpose&#8221; for clause 441. It is 
based on paragraph 13(2) to (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="443" SerialNumber="495">Clause 443: Restriction of relief for interest where tax relief schemes involved 
1275. This clause prevents a company from bringing into account debits for interest 
paid as part of a scheme or arrangements, the sole or main benefit of which is the 
obtaining of the debit for that interest. It is based on section 787 of ICTA. 
 
1276. Section 787 differs from paragraph 13 of Schedule 9 to FA 1996, rewritten in 
clauses 441 and 442, in the following ways: 
    &#8226; paragraph 13 covers all debits and not just interest; 
 
    &#8226; paragraph 13 looks at the purposes of a loan relationship and section 787 at the 
       benefit that might be expected to accrue from a scheme or arrangements; 
 
    &#8226; where section 787 is in point the whole of the interest is disallowed whereas 
       paragraph 13 restricts only so much of the debit on the loan relationship as on a 
       just and reasonable apportionment is attributable to the unallowable purpose. 
 
1277. For these reasons both paragraph 13 of Schedule 9 to FA 1996 and section 787 
of ICTA are rewritten in full. 
 
1278. Section 787(1A) of ICTA requires the reference in section 787(1) to giving 
relief in respect of a payment of interest to be read &#8220;as including&#8221; a debit for interest 
under Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 1996 (loan relationships). This must be interpreted as 
applying that subsection to loan relationships alone as debits for interest are only 
allowed under Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 1996 (section 337A(2)(a) of ICTA). 
Subsection (1) is worded accordingly. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="444" SerialNumber="496">Clause 444: Transactions not at arm&#8217;s length: general 
1279. This and the following seven clauses provide rules for where transactions in 
respect of a loan relationship are not on arm&#8217;s length terms. It is based on 
section 103(1) of, and paragraph 11(1) to (3A) of Schedule 9 to, FA 1996. The clause 
requires debits and credits to be determined as if the related transaction in respect of 
which they arise were on arm&#8217;s length terms. Exchange gains and losses are not 
affected. Schedule 28AA to ICTA (provision not at arm&#8217;s length) has priority where it 
also applies (see clause 445). 
 
1280. Paragraph 11(2) refers to debits arising from the acquisition of rights under a 
loan relationship. The 1996 notes on clauses read &#8220;&#8230;[paragraph 11] specifically does 
not affect the buyer when it has paid less than the market price &#8211; we are quite happy 
when it comes to sell the loan relationship, in computing the profit, it only gets the 
amount it actually paid taken into account at cost rather than market value&#8221;. When the 
company comes to sell the loan relationship the transaction may not be at arm&#8217;s 
length, but the arm&#8217;s length value is clearly still intended to apply. 
 
1281. It was therefore intended that the debits refer to the entries in the asset account 
on the acquisition of a loan relationship acquired at below market value. 
 
1282. Paragraph 6204 of the Corporate Finance Manual reads: 
 
    FA96/SCH9/PARA11(2) provides that the Para 11(1) adjustment does not apply to debits arising from 
    the purchase of a loan relationship at less than market value. 
 
    Although this rule is primarily aimed at cases where the vendor is not within the charge to corporation 
    tax, it does apply in other cases too. So, when a company buys a debt at undervalue (not at arm&#8217;s 
    length), there is no adjustment in its accounts; it brings in the lower value and is taxed on the full 
1283. Ghosh and Johnson&#8217;s &#8220;Taxation of Loan Relationships and Derivatives&#8221;, in 
referring to paragraph 11(2), agrees with this interpretation. Paragraph 6.351 reads: 
 
    However, there is no market value uplift for the purpose of computing any debits arising from the 
    acquisition of rights under a loan relationship at less than market value (para 11(2)). &#8220;Debit&#8221; here 
    means an &#8220;expense&#8221;, ie acquisition cost. 
 
1284. In most instances transactions other than at arm&#8217;s length are between group 
companies and Schedule 28AA to ICTA will apply. Schedule 28AA has precedence 
as a result of paragraph 11(1A) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996 and paragraph 11(1) of 
Schedule 9 will not then apply. 
 
1285. A rewrite change has not been introduced to reflect this meaning of 
paragraph 11(2) because some non-HMRC specialists on loan relationship disagree 
with this interpretation. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="445" SerialNumber="497">Clause 445: Disapplication of section 444 where Schedule 28AA to ICTA applies 
1286. This clause provides an exception to clause 444. Where Schedule 28AA to 
ICTA also applies in respect of the related transaction, clause 444 does not apply. It is 
based on paragraph 11(1A) and (1B) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. The clause also 
excludes an adjustment to exchange gains and losses from any Schedule 28AA 
adjustments. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="446" SerialNumber="498">Clause 446: Bringing into account adjustments made under Schedule 28AA to 
ICTA 
1287. This clause requires credits and debits under this Part to reflect adjustments 
made under Schedule 28AA of ICTA. It is based on paragraph 16(1) and (2) of 
Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="447" SerialNumber="499">Clause 447: Exchange gains and losses on debtor relationships: loans 
disregarded under Schedule 28AA to ICTA 
1288. This and the following four clauses provide rules for exchange gains and 
losses on loan relationships which are not on arm&#8217;s length terms. It is based on 
paragraph 11A(1) to (3) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996 and paragraph 8(1) and (3) of 
Schedule 28AA to ICTA. 
 
1289. The clause leaves exchange gains and losses, or a proportion of them, out of 
account where, under Schedule 28AA to ICTA, the whole or part of a loan 
representing a debtor relationship is ignored. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="448" SerialNumber="500">Clause 448: Exchange gains and losses on debtor relationships: equity notes 
where holder associated with issuer 
1290. This clause applies where interest is to be treated as a distribution under 
section 209(2)(e)(vii) of ICTA. It is based on paragraph 11A(1) of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. Exchange gains and losses on the security giving rise to that interest are left 
out of account in computing gains under this Part in respect of the debtor company. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="449" SerialNumber="501">Clause 449: Exchange gains and losses on creditor relationships: no 
corresponding debtor relationship 
1291. This clause applies where a company is in a creditor relationship and the 
transaction giving rise to the loan would not have been made on arm&#8217;s length terms. It 
is based on paragraph 11A(4) and (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. The clause leaves 
exchange gains and losses out of account where there is no corresponding debtor 
relationship (explained in clause 450). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="450" SerialNumber="502">Clause 450: Meaning of &#8220;corresponding debtor relationship&#8221; 
1292. This clause provides the meaning of &#8220;corresponding debtor relationship&#8221; for 
the purposes of clause 449. It is based on paragraph 11A(4) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1293. Part 2(6) of Schedule 11 to F(No 2)A 2005 repeals the words &#8220;or would apart 
from section 84A(2) to (10) of this Act&#8221; in paragraph 11A(4)(c) of Schedule 9 to FA 
1996 (rewritten in subsection (6)) with effect from a day to be appointed. This 
subsection will therefore cease to have effect from an appointed day (see Part 8 (loan 
relationships) of Schedule 2 to the Bill). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="451" SerialNumber="503">Clause 451: Exception to section 449 where loan exceeds arm&#8217;s length amount 
1294. Where a loan would, on arm&#8217;s length terms, have been of an amount more 
than nil but less than the full amount this clause takes into account a suitable 
proportion of the exchange gains and losses for the purposes of this Part. It is based on 
paragraph 11A(5) and (6) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="452" SerialNumber="504">Clause 452: Exchange gains and losses where loan not on arm&#8217;s length terms 
1295. This clause provides that, where a guarantor company is connected to the 
creditor company, a claim under paragraph 6D of Schedule 28AA to ICTA is assumed 
to apply to exchange gains and losses as well as interest. It is based on 
paragraph 11A(7) to (10) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
 
1296. Paragraph 6D of Schedule 28AA to ICTA applies where a company has an 
interest payment reduced by the transfer pricing rules of that Schedule and the loan on 
which that interest is paid is guaranteed by another company. The guarantor company 
may make a claim to be treated as if it had itself paid the interest. The guarantor 
company then obtains the deduction that was disallowed to the paying company. This 
is called a &#8220;compensating adjustment&#8221;. The interest is allowed to the extent that an 
independent lender would take the guarantee into account in determining the 
borrower&#8217;s debt capacity. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="453" SerialNumber="505">Clause 453: Connected parties deriving benefit from creditor relationships 
1297. This clause provides that if a company receives less than a commercial return 
under a loan relationship and, in consequence, a connected company derives benefit 
as a result of that relationship, credits representing that benefit are brought into 
account in computing the creditor company&#8217;s gains. It is based on section 93C of 
FA 1996. This counters an avoidance device whereby a company arranges for the 
equivalent value of interest that would otherwise be received to be passed by the 
borrower to a connected company which is not a party to the relationship. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="454" SerialNumber="506">Clause 454: Application of fair value accounting: reset bonds etc 
1298. This clause provides rules for debits and credits on loan relationships 
represented by bonds on which the terms change after issue, to be determined on the 
basis of fair value accounting. It is based on section 88A of FA 1996. 
 
1299. Principally, this clause counters avoidance where companies subscribe for 
reset bonds which increase in value after issue and are transferred to another group 
company at cost under clause 340 onwards. That company is then sold outside the 
group at market value with the profit on the bond reflected in the capital gain on the 
sale of the subsidiary and not as a credit under this Part. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="455" SerialNumber="507">Clause 455: Disposals for consideration not fully recognised by accounting 
practice 
1300. This clause provides that rights disposed of under a creditor relationship are to 
be brought into account where the disposal is not wholly recognised in the accounts 
and there is an intention to avoid tax. It is based on paragraph 11B of Schedule 9 to 
FA 1996. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="16" SerialNumber="508">Chapter 16: Non-trading deficits 
Overview 
1301. This Chapter provides the rules for deficits on loan relationships which are not 
used for the company&#8217;s trade. 
 
<Clause Number="456" SerialNumber="509">Clause 456: Introduction to Chapter 
1302. This clause provides a general introduction to the Chapter. It is based on 
section 83(1) of, and paragraph 5 of Schedule 8 to, FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="457" SerialNumber="510">Clause 457: Basic rule for deficits: carry forward to accounting periods after 
deficit period 
1303. This clause provides that deficits which are neither surrendered as group relief 
nor set-off against profits of the loss period or earlier periods are carried forward and 
set against against the non-trading profits of the following accounting period. It is 
based on section 83(3A) of, and paragraph 4(1) to (3) and (6) of Schedule 8 to, 
FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="458" SerialNumber="511">Clause 458: Claim to carry forward deficit to later accounting periods 
1304. This clause allows a company to make a claim to carry forward the deficit 
from the period in which it arose without the need to set it against non-trading profits 
under clause 457. It is based on paragraph 4(3) to (5) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 
1305. The deficit is then treated as if it arose in the &#8220;first later period&#8221; and falls to be 
carried forward to the subsequent period (ie it cannot be set against total profits of that 
first later accounting period). This rule also applies where no claim is made but the 
deficit cannot be set against non-trading profits of the first subsequent period. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="459" SerialNumber="512">Clause 459: Claim to set off deficit against profits of deficit period or earlier 
periods 
1306. This clause allows a company (unless it is a charity) to claim that deficits 
which have not been surrendered as group relief may be set off against other profits of 
the deficit period or carried back against profits from loan relationships in an earlier 
accounting period. It is based on section 83(2) and (5) of FA 1996. 
 
1307. Section 83(2)(a) of FA 1996 (set-off against other profits of the deficit period) 
allows the deficit to be set off against &#8220;any profits&#8230;.(of whatever description)&#8221;. 
&#8220;Profits of any description&#8221; are the &#8220;total profits&#8221; in section 9(3) of ICTA and this is 
reflected in subsection (1)(a). 
 
1308. Section 83(2)(c) of FA 1996 (set-off carried back to earlier periods) refers 
only to set-off &#8220;against profits&#8221;. Paragraph 3(4) of Schedule 8 to FA 1996 makes it 
clear that the profits in section 83(2)(c) are only profits on non-trading loan 
relationships. This restriction has been brought out in subsection (1)(b). Full details of 
the profits against which a deficit can be set under subsection (1)(b) are given in 
clause 463 (signposted in subsection (6)). 
 
1309. Section 83(5) of FA 1996 has been rewritten in subsection (3) and excludes 
charities from making a claim under subsection (1) of this clause. Before its repeal in 
FA 2002 section 83(2)(b) of FA 1996 allowed deficits to be surrendered as group 
relief. Section 83(5) was not consequentially amended when section 83(2)(b) was 
repealed and continues to refer to group relief. 
 
1310. The reference to group relief is unnecessary since section 403(2) of ICTA, 
which allows non-trading deficits for the purposes of group relief, only provides for 
deficits to which section 83 of FA 1996 applies (see section 403ZC of ICTA). So all 
that is necessary to prevent the deficit of a charitable company from being surrendered 
as group relief is to provide that claims under this clause may not be made in respect 
of the deficits of a charitable company and this is what subsection (3) does. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="460" SerialNumber="513">Clause 460: Time limits and procedure for claims under section 459(1) 
1311. This clause provides the time limit for a claim under clause 459. It is based on 
section 83(6) to (8) of FA 1996. 
 
1312. Subsection (1)(b) rewrites &#8220;the Board&#8221; as &#8220;an officer of Revenue and 
Customs&#8221;. See Change 1 in Annex 1. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="461" SerialNumber="514">Clause 461: Claim to set off deficit against other profits for the deficit period 
1313. This clause provides that, following a claim under clause 459(1), the deficit is 
set off against the profits identified in the claim but after trade losses and before 
certain other reliefs. It is based on paragraph 1(1) to (4) of Schedule 8 to FA 1996. 
 
1314. Although the set-off against profits of the deficit period is against total profits, 
the general rule in subsection (2) is that the set-off is against the profits of the 
company identified in the claim. In the figure of total profits any management 
expenses will already have been deducted under clause 1219. The profits identified in 
the claim will therefore be after management expenses. If the company has more than 
one source of income together with a reduction for management expenses, an officer 
of Revenue and Customs will agree the amount of income specified in the claim on a 
just and reasonable basis. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="462" SerialNumber="515">Clause 462: Claim to carry back deficit to earlier accounting periods 
1315. This clause explains how a claim to carry back a deficit to an earlier period 
under clause 459(1)(b) applies, allowing the deficit to be set against profits of later 
accounting periods before earlier ones. It is based on paragraph 3(1) to (3) of 
Schedule 8 to FA 1996. 
 
1316. Subsection (2) does not rewrite paragraph 3(2)(a)(ii) of Schedule 8 to 
FA 1996, which refers to section 83(4) of FA 1996, as section 83(4) has been 
repealed. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="463" SerialNumber="516">Clause 463: Profits available for relief under section 462 
1317. This clause sets out which profits may be reduced by a deficit carried back 
against profits of an earlier period under clause 459. It is based on paragraph 3(4) 
to (7) of Schedule 8 to FA 1996. 
 
1318. The reliefs in subsection (5) are set against the profits before the 
apportionment required by subsection (3) to give the &#8220;amount available for relief&#8221;. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="17" SerialNumber="517">Chapter 17: Priority rules 
Overview 
1319. This Chapter gives the basic boundary rule for loan relationships in clause 464 
and excludes debits and credits on distributions. 
 
<Clause Number="464" SerialNumber="518">Clause 464: Priority of this Part for corporation tax purposes 
1320. This clause provides the main boundary provision applying to loan 
relationships. It is based on section 80(5) of, and paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 9 to, 
FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="465" SerialNumber="519">Clause 465: Exclusion of distributions except in tax avoidance cases 
1321. This clause excludes distributions from being brought into account under this 
Part unless they arise in consequence of avoidance arrangements. It is based on 
paragraph 1(1), (1A) and (2) of Schedule 9 to FA 1996. 

 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="18" SerialNumber="520">Chapter 18: General and supplementary provisions 
Overview 
1322. This Chapter explains when companies are connected for the purposes of 
Parts 5 and 6 as well as providing definitions of &#8220;control&#8221;, &#8220;major interest&#8221; and other 
expressions used in those Parts. 
 
<Clause Number="466" SerialNumber="521">Clause 466: Companies connected for an accounting period 
1323. This clause explains when two companies are connected for an accounting 
period for the purposes of any provisions that apply it. It is based on sections 87(3) 
and (4) and 87A(1) of FA 1996. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="467" SerialNumber="522">Clause 467: Connections where partnerships are involved 
1324. This clause explains when loan relationships are taken to be between 
connected companies in the case of debts owed by or to a partnership. It is based on 
section 87(5A) and (5B) of FA 1996. 
 
1325. Subsection (4) adopts the language (&#8220;in accordance with the firm&#8217;s profit- 
sharing arrangements&#8221;) of clause 1262 in Part 17 (partnerships) which rewrites 
section 114(2) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="468" SerialNumber="523">Clause 468: Connection between companies to be ignored in some circumstances 
1326. This clause provides that a connection between a company in a creditor 
relationship and the company in the debtor relationship is ignored in certain 
circumstances. It is based on section 88(1), (5) and (6) of FA 1996. The circumstances 
are set out in clauses 469 and 471. The clause also provides that a company is treated 
for these purposes as being in a debtor relationship when the debt is &#8220;dog-legged&#8221; 
through intermediaries. 
 
1327. Section 88(1) and (5) of FA 1996 refer to persons standing in a debtor 
relationship. &#8220;Persons&#8221; here has been rewritten as applying to companies only. See 
Change 56 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="469" SerialNumber="524">Clause 469: Creditors who are financial traders 
1328. This clause sets out the circumstances under which connectedness between a 
company in a creditor relationship and one in a debtor relationship is ignored under 
clause 468. It is based on section 88(2) and (3) of FA 1996. The clause allows 
financial traders who buy and sell debt of connected companies in the same way that 
they buy and sell debt of non-connected companies to be exempt from the 
connectedness rules. 
 
1329. Section 88(2)(f) of FA 1996 provides the condition that, for a three month 
period, the equivalent of 30% or more of the assets should not be in the beneficial 
ownership of &#8220;connected persons&#8221;. This has been rewritten as &#8220;connected 
companies&#8221;. See Change 56 in Annex 1. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="470" SerialNumber="525">Clause 470: Section 469: supplementary provisions

that apply it, for example clause 466. It is based on section 87A(1) to (3) of FA 1996. 
 
1334. Subsection (6)(b) adopts the language (&#8220;in accordance with the firm&#8217;s profit- 
sharing arrangements&#8221;) of clause 1262 in Part 17 (partnerships) which rewrites 
section 114(2) of ICTA.
