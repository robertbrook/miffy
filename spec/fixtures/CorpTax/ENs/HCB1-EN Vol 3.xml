</TextSection><Part Number="9" SerialNumber="2">Part 9: Intellectual property: know-how and patents 
Overview 
2289. This Part rewrites some special provisions in Chapter 1 of Part 13 of ICTA 
which charge to corporation tax certain receipts from intellectual property. The 
corresponding rules for income tax are in Chapter 2 of Part 5 of ITTOIA. 
 
2290. This Part applies to capital sums arising from the disposal of know-how in 
certain circumstances and capital sums from the sale of patent rights. 
 
2291. This Part does not rewrite those parts of the provisions in Chapter 1 of Part 13 
of ICTA which apply to trades (such as section 531(1) to (3) of ICTA). Such parts of 
the source provisions are rewritten in Chapter 13 of Part 3 of this Bill. 
 
2292. This Part does not apply to amounts arising from intangible fixed assets within 
Part 8 of this Bill. The rules in Chapter 16 of Part 8 define which assets and amounts 
come within Part 8. If an asset is within Part 8 that Part gives all the tax rules that 
apply. 
 
2293. The rules in this Part largely mirror the corresponding rules for income tax and 
bring the corporation tax provisions back into line with their income tax counterparts. 
Where there are differences between the two they derive mainly from the way in 
which the two taxes are charged and the possibility that accounting periods, unlike tax 
years, will not be of 12 months duration. 
 
<Chapter Number="1" SerialNumber="3">Chapter 1: Introduction 
<Clause Number="907" SerialNumber="4">Clause 907: Overview of Part 
2294. This clause introduces the charges applied by the Part. It is new. 
 
2295. Subsections (4) and (5) alert readers to the primacy of the intangible fixed 
assets rules in Part 8 of the Bill. Very broadly, the rules in Part 8 apply only to 
intangible fixed assets that were created or acquired on or after 1 April 2002. 
Otherwise the rules in this Part continue to apply. 
 
2296. Royalties from intellectual property are an exception to this as they 
automatically fall within Part 8 if they are recognised for accounting purposes on or 
after 1 April 2002. Most income from intellectual property is in the form of royalties. 
So specific rules in the source legislation applying to royalties are obsolete in a way 
that rules applying to other (mainly capital) amounts are not. To the extent that, 
exceptionally, other income receipts from intellectual property not within Part 8 may 
arise (such as casual profits from the exploitation of intellectual property charged in 
the source legislation under Case V or VI of Schedule D) those receipts will be 
subject to the &#8220;sweep&#8211;up&#8221; charge in clause 979 of this Bill. 
2297. For this reason there is no need, in the corporation tax context, for rules 
equivalent to those in sections 579 to 582 of ITTOIA (which apply to royalties and 
other income from intellectual property). 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="2" SerialNumber="5">Chapter 2: Disposals of know-how 
<Clause Number="908" SerialNumber="6">Clause 908: Charge to tax on profits from disposals of know-how 
2298. The clauses in Chapter 2 deal with consideration received for the disposal of 
know-how. This clause applies the charge to corporation tax on income to the 
proceeds of certain disposals of know-how. It is based on section 531 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 583 of ITTOIA. 
 
2299. Under the source legislation, income from disposals of know-how is charged 
to tax under Schedule D Case VI of ICTA. 
2300. Subsection (1) applies the charge to corporation tax on income. 
Subsection (1)(b) is based on section 531(8) of ICTA but the words &#8220;whether absolute 
or qualified&#8221; are omitted since they are superfluous. 
 
2301. Subsection (5) restores a definition of &#8220;mineral deposits&#8221; that applied before 
CAA was enacted. This change reproduces Change 51 in ITTOIA and so brings the 
income and corporation tax codes back into line. See Change 41 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="909" SerialNumber="7">Clause 909: Exceptions to charge under section 908 
2302. This clause sets out the exceptions to the charge under clause 908. It is based 
on section 531 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 584 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="910" SerialNumber="8">Clause 910: Profits charged under section 908 
2303. This clause sets out the amount charged to tax under clause 908. It is based on 
section 531 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 585 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
2304. Subsection (3) is new and gives a signpost to the clause which deals with 
contributions to expenditure. This is necessary because section 532 of ICTA treats 
section 531 of ICTA as if it were contained in CAA. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="3" SerialNumber="9">Chapter 3: Sales of Patent Rights 
<Clause Number="911" SerialNumber="10">Clause 911: Overview of Chapter 
2305. This clause introduces the rules in this Chapter about the sales of patent rights. 
It is new. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="912" SerialNumber="11">Clause 912: Charge to tax on profits from sales of patent rights 
2306. This clause applies the charge to corporation tax on income to capital sums 
from the sale of patent rights. It is based on sections 524 and 533 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 587 of ITTOIA. 
2307. Section 524(5) of ICTA is not rewritten because it does not appear to add 
anything to the proposition set out in clause 5(3) of this Bill (which defines the scope 
of the charge to corporation tax on a non-UK resident company trading in the UK 
through a permanent establishment in the UK). Any non-capital proceeds of the sale 
of patent rights will be amounts of income forming part of a non-UK resident 
company&#8217;s chargeable profits by virtue of clause 19(3)(b) of this Bill (which defines 
the chargeable profits of a non-UK resident company). So the company will be within 
the charge to corporation tax in respect of such amounts. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="913" SerialNumber="12">Clause 913: Profits charged under section 912 
2308. This clause sets out the amount charged to tax under clause 912. It is based on 
section 524 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 588 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
2309. This clause is subject to the spreading rules in clauses 914 to 917. 
 
2310. Subsection (2) defines deductible costs as the capital cost of the rights sold 
plus any incidental expenses of sale. This makes it explicit that such expenses may be 
deducted. The types of expenses which may be allowed under this clause are not 
listed. Incidental expenses which relate to both capital sale proceeds and other sums 
not chargeable to tax under clause 912 are effectively apportioned under the rules 
about net proceeds of sale in clause 929. 
 
2311. Subsection (5) is new and includes a signpost to clause 926 which deals with 
contributions to expenditure. This signpost is necessary because section 532 of ICTA 
treats section 524 of ICTA as if it were contained in CAA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="914" SerialNumber="13">Clause 914: UK resident companies: proceeds of sale not received in instalments 
2312. This clause sets out the spreading rules if the company chargeable by virtue of 
clause 912 is UK resident and does not receive the proceeds of sale in instalments. It 
is based on section 524 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 590(1) to (3) and (6) of ITTOIA. 
 
2313. The approach in this clause differs from that in section 590 of ITTOIA. The 
latter also deals with the case where the taxpayer is UK resident and receives the 
proceeds of sale in instalments but in this Part that case is dealt with in a separate 
clause (see clause 915). 
 
2314. Subsection (5) states the time limit for elections under subsection (4). Unlike 
the source legislation this clause does not specify to whom the election must be made. 
But the general rules about claims and elections in Schedule 18 to FA 1998 require 
elections to be made in a return or, if that is not possible, to &#8220;an officer of Revenue 
and Customs&#8221; in accordance with Schedule 1A to TMA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="915" SerialNumber="14">Clause 915: UK resident companies: proceeds of sale received in instalments 
2315. This clause sets out the spreading rules if the company chargeable by virtue of 
clause 912 is UK resident and receives the proceeds of sale in instalments. It is based 
on section 524 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 590(1) 
and (4) to (6) of ITTOIA. 
 
2316. Subsection (5) states the time limit for elections under subsection (4). Unlike 
the source legislation this clause does not specify to whom the election must be made. 
But the general rules about claims and elections in Schedule 18 to FA 1998 require 
elections to be made in a return or, if that is not possible, to &#8220;an officer of Revenue 
and Customs&#8221; in accordance with Schedule 1A to TMA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="916" SerialNumber="15">Clause 916: Non-UK resident companies: proceeds of sale not received in 
instalments 
2317. This clause sets out how non-UK resident companies are taxed on capital sums 
from the sale of patent rights if the sale proceeds are not received in instalments. It is 
based on section 524 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 591 of ITTOIA. 
 
2318. Subsection (4) states the time limit for making an election under 
subsection (3). The reference in section 524(6) of ICTA to &#8220;the Board&#8221; has not been 
reproduced and this clause does not specify to whom the election must be made. But 
the general rules about claims and elections in Schedule 18 to FA 1998 require 
elections to be made in a return or, if that is not possible, to an &#8220;officer of Revenue 
and Customs&#8221; in accordance with Schedule 1A to TMA. This change reproduces 
Change 149 in ITTOIA and so brings the income and corporation tax codes back into 
line. See Change 1 in Annex 1. 
 
2319. A non-UK resident company is within the charge to corporation tax in respect 
of sales of patent rights only if it is carrying on a trade in the UK through a UK 
permanent establishment and the patent is held for that trade (see clause 19). 
Subsection (5) of this clause (and of clause 917) is relevant if such a company, having 
elected for spreading under subsection (3) of this clause (or of clause 917) ceases 
within the maximum allowed spreading period of six years to be within the charge to 
corporation tax in respect of the trade it was carrying on through its UK permanent 
establishment. If (for example) in year four the company ceased to carry on the trade 
through a UK permanent establishment then the capital sum would be spread rateably 
over four years and any earlier spreading based on a presumption that it would 
continue to carry on the trade in the UK through a UK permanent establishment for 
the whole six years would be revised in accordance with subsection (6) of this clause 
(or of clause 917). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="917" SerialNumber="16">Clause 917: Non-UK resident companies: proceeds of sale received in instalments 
2320. This clause sets out how non-UK resident companies are taxed on capital sums 
from the sale of patent rights if the sale proceeds are received in instalments. It is 
based on section 524 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 592 of ITTOIA. 
 
2321. Subsection (2) makes explicit what is implicit in the source legislation. 
 
2322. Subsection (4) states the time limit for elections under subsection (3). The 
reference in section 524(6) of ICTA to &#8220;the Board&#8221; has not been reproduced and this 
clause does not specify to whom the election must be made. But the general rules 
about claims and elections in Schedule 18 to FA 1998 require elections to be made in 
a return or, if that is not possible, to &#8220;an officer of Revenue and Customs&#8221; in 
accordance with Schedule 1A to TMA. So Change 149 in ITTOIA is reproduced to 
bring the income and corporation tax codes back into line. See Change 1 in Annex 1. 
2323. The note on clause 916(5) is also relevant to subsection (5) of this clause. 
 
2324. Section 524(10) of ICTA is not rewritten. Section 524 of ICTA prescribes 
particular tax treatments with alternatives available by election. Section 524(10) of 
ICTA requires claims for relief under section 524 to be made to the Board. The claim 
relates to the spreading over six years of capital sums received from the sale of patent 
rights for the purposes of charging the sum to tax. As spreading is automatic for UK 
resident companies, the claim can be relevant only to non-UK resident companies. 
However, section 524(6) of ICTA, which deals with spreading rules for non-UK 
resident companies, refers to an election the rules for which are fully stated in that 
subsection and rewritten in clauses 916 and 917. Section 524(10) of ICTA is, 
therefore, superfluous. 
</Clause><Clause Number="918" SerialNumber="17">Clause 918: Winding up of a body corporate 
2325. This clause deals with a body corporate which is chargeable to corporation tax 
under clause 912 if it commences to be wound up. It is based on section 525 of ICTA. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 594 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="919" SerialNumber="18">Clause 919: Deduction of tax from payments to non-UK resident companies 
2326. This clause provides rules relating to the deduction of tax from payments to 
non-UK resident companies which are liable for tax under clause 912 on profits from 
the sale of the whole or part of any patent rights. It is based on section 524 of ICTA. 
The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 595 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="920" SerialNumber="19">Clause 920: Adjustments where tax has been deducted 
2327. This clause provides a rule relating to adjustments which may be necessary if 
tax is deducted from payments to a non-UK resident company under clause 919. It is 
based on section 524 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 596 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="921" SerialNumber="20">Clause 921: Licences connected with patents 
2328. This clause provides that certain matters relating to the acquisition or grant of 
a licence in respect of patent rights are treated for the purposes of the Chapter as a 
purchase or (as the case may be) sale of patent rights. The clause is based on 
section 533 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 597 of 
ITTOIA. 
</Clause><Clause Number="922" SerialNumber="21">Clause 922: Rights to acquire future patent rights 
2329. This clause brings rights to acquire future patent rights within the patent rights 
rules in this Chapter. It is based on section 533 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 598 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="923" SerialNumber="22">Clause 923: Sums paid for Crown use etc treated as paid under licence 
2330. This clause provides that sums paid for Crown use, or by a government of a 
country outside the United Kingdom are, in certain circumstances, to be treated as 
paid under a licence. It is based on section 533 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 599 of ITTOIA. 
 
2331. The reference in section 533(4) of ICTA to &#8220;sections 46 to 49 of the Patents 
Act 1949&#8221; has not been reproduced in this section. This is because patents granted 
under these provisions have ceased to have effect so it is unnecessary to reproduce 
this reference. The removal of this unnecessary material follows the line adopted in 
section 482 of CAA and mirrors what was done in section 599 of ITTOIA. 
 
2332. The words &#8220;used&#8221; and &#8220;use&#8221; in this clause (which correspond with the 
relieving legislation in section 482 of CAA) are intended to be read widely and cover 
&#8220;make&#8221; and &#8220;sell&#8221;. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="4" SerialNumber="23">Chapter 4: Relief from corporation tax on patent income 
<Clause Number="924" SerialNumber="24">Clause 924: Relief for expenses: patent income 
2333. This clause provides relief for certain expenses in connection with patents. It is 
based on sections 526 and 528 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 600 of ITTOIA. 
 
2334. The relief is on the basis of expenses incurred. This relaxes any requirement in 
the source legislation that fees have to be paid before a deduction can be made. 
 
2335. Subsection (2) defines &#8220;patent application and maintenance expenses&#8221; for the 
purposes of this clause. Relief for such expenses is excluded from the scope of this 
clause if the expenditure is incurred for the purposes of a trade carried on by the 
payer. This is because there is a similar provision for trading expenses connected with 
patents (in clause 89 of the Bill). 
2336. Subsection (4) gives a signpost to clause 926 which deals with contributions to 
expenditure. This is necessary because section 532 of ICTA treats section 526 
and 528 of ICTA as if those provisions were contained in CAA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="925" SerialNumber="25">Clause 925: How relief is given under section 924 
2337. This clause sets out how relief is given when a claim is made under clause 924 
for patent expenses to be set against patent income. It is based on sections 526, 528 
and 533 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 601 of ITTOIA. 
 
2338. Subsection (2) allows relief for expenditure against patent income in the 
accounting period in which the expenditure is incurred. However, if the expenses 
exceed the patent income in the accounting period, the surplus expenses cannot be 
used to create a loss under this clause. Any such surplus is dealt with in accordance 
with subsection (3). 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="5" SerialNumber="26">Chapter 5: Supplementary 
<Clause Number="926" SerialNumber="27">Clause 926: Contributions to expenditure 
2339. This clause restricts expenditure allowable under clause 910, clause 913 and 
clause 924 to the extent that the expenditure is met by a public body or someone other 
than the company. It is based on section 532 of ICTA and section 532 of CAA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 603 of ITTOIA. 
 
2340. Subsection (3) is new and excludes the application of this clause to incidental 
expenses incurred by the seller of patent rights (see clause 913(2)(b)). This is because 
section 524 of ICTA only bites in the first place on the net proceeds of a sale. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="927" SerialNumber="28">Clause 927: Contributions not made by public bodies nor eligible for tax relief 
2341. This clause qualifies the general rule in clause 926 by providing that 
contributions not made by public bodies may still be eligible as deductible 
expenditure in certain circumstances. The clause is based on section 532 of ICTA and 
section 536 of CAA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 604 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="928" SerialNumber="29">Clause 928: Exchanges 
2342. This clause extends the definition of a sale of property to include exchanges of 
property for the purposes of this Part. It is based on section 532 of ICTA and 
sections 453 and 572 of CAA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 605 
of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="929" SerialNumber="30">Clause 929: Apportionment where property sold together 
2343. This clause provides for the apportionment of sale proceeds and expenditure 
on a just and reasonable basis if property within the scope of this Part is sold with 
other property. It is based on section 532 of ICTA and sections 453 and 562 of CAA. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 606 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="930" SerialNumber="31">Clause 930: Questions about apportionments affecting two or more persons 
2344. This clause provides for questions relating to apportionment under clause 929 
that affect two or more persons to be determined by the body prescribed by 
section 563 of CAA. It is based on section 532 of ICTA and section 563 of CAA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 607 of ITTOIA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="931" SerialNumber="32">Clause 931: Meaning of &#8220;capital sums&#8221; etc 
2345. This clause applies section 4 of CAA (which defines &#8220;capital expenditure&#8221; and 
&#8220;capital sums&#8221;) for the purposes of the Part. It is based on section 532 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 608 of ITTOIA.

<Chapter Number="1" SerialNumber="34">Chapter 1: Introduction 
<Clause Number="932" SerialNumber="35">Clause 932: Overview of Part 
2346. This clause describes the function and contents of the Part. It is new. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="2" SerialNumber="36">Chapter 2: Dividends from non-UK resident companies 
<Clause Number="933" SerialNumber="37">Clause 933: Charge to tax on dividends of non-UK resident companies 
2347. This clause sets out the charge to corporation tax on dividends from a 
company that is not resident in the UK. It is based on sections 9, 18 and 70 of ICTA. 
The corresponding income tax provision is section 402 of ITTOIA. 
 
2348. The approach adopted in ICTA is to compute income for corporation tax from 
each type of source in the same way as for income tax, and then apply any specific 
corporation tax rules. Following the enactment of ITTOIA, which set up a different 
scheme for income tax, sources of income for corporation tax have continued to be 
computed under the rules of the separate Schedules and Cases. Dividends paid by a 
non-UK resident company were charged under Schedule D Case V. 
 
2349. The clause mirrors section 402 of ITTOIA by explicitly excluding capital 
dividends &#8211; the Schedule D Case V charge was a charge on income and the wording 
of the clause reflects this. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="3" SerialNumber="38">Chapter 3: Beneficiaries&#8217; income from estates in administration 
Overview 
2350. This Chapter charges to corporation tax income paid or payable by personal 
representatives to residuary beneficiaries from estates in administration. The Chapter 
rewrites sections 695 to 702 of ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in 
Chapter 6 of Part 5 of ITTOIA. 
 
2351. Personal representatives are taxable at the basic rate or the dividend ordinary 
rate on any income they receive during the administration period. When the income 
which arises to the personal representatives is paid to the residuary beneficiaries, it is 
treated as having borne income tax at those rates. 
 
<Clause Number="934" SerialNumber="39">Clause 934: Charge to tax on estate income 
2352. This clause applies the charge to corporation tax on income to estate income. 
It is based on sections 695(2) to (4), 696(3) and (6), 698(3) and 701(11) of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 649 of ITTOIA. 
 
2353. The approach of Part 16 of ICTA is to deem sums to have been paid as income 
for all tax purposes. In the case of both UK and foreign estates, the income is not 
charged under a particular Schedule or Case and it is implicit that tax is charged on 
those sums. This clause applies to both UK and foreign estates. And it has now been 
made explicit that the charge to tax applies to all estate income which is treated as 
arising under the Chapter from a deceased person&#8217;s estate. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="935" SerialNumber="40">Clause 935: Absolute, limited and discretionary interests 
2354. This clause defines the three types of interest in the whole or part of the 
residue of an estate. It is based on sections 698(1) and (3) and 701(2) and (3) of ICTA. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 650 of ITTOIA. 
 
2355. Subsections (1)(b) and 2(b) reflect the fact that the amount of any residue, and 
the income from it, can only be an estimate until the residue has been ascertained. 
 
2356. Subsection (4) covers the following four situations: 
 
    &#8226; where income/capital is properly payable directly to the person with the 
       interest; 
 
    &#8226; where income/capital is properly payable to the person with the interest 
       indirectly through a trustee or other person; 
 
    &#8226; where income/capital is properly payable for the benefit of the person with the 
       interest, to another person, and that income/capital is paid directly to that other 
       person; and 
 
    &#8226; where income/capital is properly payable to a person where that person is a 
       personal representative and subsection (5) applies. 
 
2357. Subsection (5) deals with the situation where personal representatives would 
have an absolute or limited interest in the residue of another deceased person&#8217;s estate 
if a right they have as personal representatives were vested in them for their own 
benefit. In these circumstances they are treated as having that interest. The term 
&#8220;personal representatives&#8221; is defined in clause 968. The definition corresponds with 
that in section 989 of ITA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="936" SerialNumber="41">Clause 936: Meaning of &#8220;UK estate&#8221; and &#8220;foreign estate&#8221; 
2358. This clause defines &#8220;UK estate&#8221; and &#8220;foreign estate&#8221; for the purposes of this 
Chapter. It is based on sections 699A(1B) and 701(9), (10) and (10A) of ICTA. The 
definitions in this clause underpin the whole of this Chapter. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 651 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="937" SerialNumber="42">Clause 937: Absolute interests in residue 
2359. This clause sets out the basis on which estate income is treated as arising in an 
accounting period in the case of absolute interests in residue. It is based on 
section 696(3) and (5) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 652 of ITTOIA. 
2360. Subsections (2) and (3) set out the relevant conditions. A payment need not be 
made in the &#8220;final accounting period&#8221; because the net amount of estate income in that 
period is always equal to the assumed income entitlement for that period. Under 
section 696(5) of ICTA, taxing a company with an absolute interest in a residuary 
estate depends on whether the company receives payments and, in the final year of 
administration, on a fictional payment under that section. The same effect is achieved 
in this clause by determining the liability by considering the assumed income 
entitlement in all accounting periods. Assumed income entitlement is dealt with in 
clause 948. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="938" SerialNumber="43">Clause 938: Meaning of &#8220;the administration period&#8221;, &#8220;the final accounting 
period&#8221; and &#8220;the final tax year&#8221; 
2361. This clause defines &#8220;the administration period&#8221;, &#8220;the final accounting period&#8221; 
and &#8220;the final tax year&#8221;. It is based on sections 695(1), 701(13) and 702 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 653 of ITTOIA. 
 
2362. Subsection (2) defines when the administration of the estate is completed for 
Scotland. A full definition for Scotland is required because the completion of the 
administration of an estate would otherwise have no meaning under Scottish law 
(although the definition has been updated by replacing the archaic expression &#8220;for 
behoof of&#8221;). In contrast, there are cases under English law which have established that 
the administration is complete when the residue of the estate is ascertained and is 
ready for distribution. Case law explains what this means in particular circumstances 
(see, for example, R v Special Commissioners ex parte Dr Barnardo&#8217;s 
Homes (1921), 7 TC 646 HL, Daw v CIR (1928), 14 TC 58 HC and CIR v Sir Aubrey 
Smith (1930), 15 TC 661 CA). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="939" SerialNumber="44">Clause 939: Limited interests in residue 
2363. This clause deals with estate income relating to limited interests. It is based on 
section 695(2) and (3) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 654 of ITTOIA. 
 
2364. The clause sets out the basis on which estate income is treated as arising in an 
accounting period for limited interests in residue. The clause reflects the need to deal 
with accounting periods before the final accounting period. Also, a limited interest 
might cease in an accounting period before the final accounting period and sums 
might be paid in respect of that interest in a later accounting period; so that situation 
has to be provided for. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="940" SerialNumber="45">Clause 940: Discretionary interests in residue 
2365. This clause deals with estate income relating to discretionary interests in 
residue. It is based on section 698(3) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax 
is in section 655 of ITTOIA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="941" SerialNumber="46">Clause 941: UK estates 
2366. This clause sets out the amount charged to tax under clause 934 for income 
from UK estates. It is based on sections 695(2) to (4), 696(3) and (4) and 698(3) of 
ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 656 of ITTOIA. 
 
2367. As there are fundamental differences between the basis of charge for income 
from UK and foreign estates, the rules for foreign estates have been dealt with in a 
separate clause (clause 942). 
 
2368. Subsection (2) provides that income from a UK estate is charged on the gross 
amount of the estate income arising for the accounting period. This is the basic 
amount of the income grossed up at the applicable rate. &#8220;Basic amount&#8221; is a new term. 
This avoids confusion with the term &#8220;net amount&#8221; since it is the &#8220;net amount&#8221; which 
is actually charged to tax in the case of a foreign estate (except where clause 963 
(income treated as bearing income tax) applies). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="942" SerialNumber="47">Clause 942: Foreign estates 
2369. This clause sets out the amount charged to tax under clause 934 for income 
from foreign estates. It is based on sections 695(4), 696(6) and 698(3) of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 657 of ITTOIA. 
 
2370. Subsection (5) provides that, so far as the income is not within clause 963, the 
charge is on the basic amount of that income. Where the income is within clause 963, 
the charge is on the gross amount of the income calculated in accordance with 
clause 946. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="943" SerialNumber="48">Clause 943: Absolute interests 
2371. This clause explains how to calculate the basic amount of estate income for 
absolute interests. It is based on section 696(3) to (5) of ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 660 of ITTOIA. 
 
2372. This section removes all the deeming of amounts to have been paid in Part 16 
of ICTA. Instead, it looks at either amounts actually paid or the assumed income 
entitlement. It then catches all previously untaxed income due to the absolute interest 
holder by taxing the assumed income entitlement in the final accounting period. This 
avoids the two stage process inherent in section 696(5) of ICTA. 
 
2373. Subsection (3) introduces a new rule allowing excess estate deductions in the 
final year to be set off against the basic amount of estate income for the final 
accounting period. See Change 69 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="944" SerialNumber="49">Clause 944: Limited interests 
2374. This clause explains how to calculate the basic amount of estate income for

for income tax is in section 661 of ITTOIA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="945" SerialNumber="50">Clause 945: Discretionary interests 
2375. This clause identifies the basic amount of estate income relating to 
discretionary interests. It is based on sections 695(4) and 698(3) of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 662 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="946" SerialNumber="51">Clause 946: Applicable rate for grossing up basic amounts of estate income 
2376. This clause provides for basic amounts of estate income to be grossed up, as 
appropriate, for the purposes of the clauses charging income (clause 941 for UK 
estates and clause 942 for foreign estates) by reference to the rate at which tax is 
borne by the aggregate income of the estate. It is based on sections 699A and 701(3A) 
of ICTA. The aggregate income of the estate is defined in clause 947. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 663 of ITTOIA. 
 
2377. Subsection (5) explains the interaction between &#8220;the relevant tax year&#8221; and 
&#8220;accounting period&#8221; for the purposes of this Chapter. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="947" SerialNumber="52">Clause 947: Aggregate income of the estate 
2378. This clause explains what is meant by the &#8220;aggregate income of the estate&#8221; for 
a tax year. It is an important definition of general application. It is based on 
sections 701(5) and (8) and 702 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 664 of ITTOIA. 
 
2379. Subsection (2) defines the income and amounts within the aggregate income of 
the estate. Subsection (2)(b) brings in foreign source income and subsection (4) 
provides that such income takes account of any deductions which would have been 
available if it had been subject to United Kingdom income tax. So subsection (4) 
brings foreign source income into line with United Kingdom source income. 
 
2380. Subsection (5) provides that two types of income are excluded from the 
aggregate income of the estate. The exclusion detailed in subsection (5)(a) concerning 
income to which any person may become entitled under a specific disposition is new 
to the definition of the aggregate income of the estate although it is similar to 
section 697(1)(b) of ICTA which deals with amounts which are deductible from the 
aggregate income in calculating the residuary income of the estate. 
 
2381. It is not considered appropriate for income from specific dispositions or 
income from contingent interests to be treated as part of the aggregate income of the 
estate. See Change 70 in Annex 1. 
 
2382. Section 698(1) of ICTA in part deals with the position where the deceased 
person (&#8220;A&#8221;), whose estate is being administered by personal representatives, had an 
absolute or limited interest in the residue of the estate of another deceased person 
(&#8220;B&#8221;). Section 698(1) of ICTA deems the personal representatives to have the same 
interest as &#8220;A&#8221; &#8220;notwithstanding that that right is not vested in them for their own 
benefit&#8221;. The substance of this is rewritten in clause 935(5). Section 698(1) of ICTA 
also deems any income in respect of such an interest to be part of the aggregate 
income of A&#8217;s estate. This part of the source legislation is not rewritten because such 
income will fall within the definition of the aggregate income of the estate anyway, 
once the personal representatives are deemed to have the interest, because it will be 
the income of the deceased&#8217;s personal representatives as such. It is immaterial for this 
purpose that that right in relation to the estate of another deceased person &#8220;is not 
vested in them for their own benefit&#8221;. 
 
2383. It is not necessary to expand on the two types of excluded income mentioned 
in subsection (5) of this clause (with the exception of subsection (6) of this clause) 
since it will be clear when such income arises. Consequently, section 701(6) and (7) 
of ICTA (which provide the meaning for &#8220;charges on residue&#8221;) are not rewritten. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="948" SerialNumber="53">Clause 948: Assumed income entitlement 
2384. This clause explains the new concept of the &#8220;assumed income entitlement&#8221;. It 
is based on section 696(3A), (3B) and (5) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 665 of ITTOIA. 
 
2385. The concept of &#8220;assumed income entitlement&#8221; has been introduced as a tool 
for calculating the basic amount of estate income for absolute interests. It is similar to 
the &#8220;aggregated income entitlement&#8221; in section 696(3B) of ICTA but applies in a 
more straightforward way. 
 
2386. Step 4 in subsection (1) deals also with situations where a beneficiary liable to 
corporation tax was, at some earlier point during the administration period, chargeable 
to income tax. It also deals with other situations where a non-UK resident beneficiary 
becomes UK resident, when the estate is a foreign estate. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="949" SerialNumber="54">Clause 949: Residuary income of the estate 
2387. This clause explains how the residuary income of the estate is calculated. It is 
based on section 697(1) and (1A) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is 
in section 666 of ITTOIA. 
 
2388. Beneficiaries with absolute interests need to know the residuary income of the 
estate for a tax year in order to work out their assumed income entitlement. 
 
2389. Subsection (2) lists the &#8220;allowable estate deductions&#8221;. This is a new label for 
the items which may be deducted from the aggregate income of the estate. 
Subsection (2)(a) refers to &#8220;all interest paid in that year by the personal 
representatives &#8230;&#8221;. Section 697(1)(a) of ICTA refers to &#8220;the amount of any annual 
interest, annuity or other annual payment for that year which is a charge on residue 
&#8230;&#8221;. The requirements that interest must be annual and also a charge on residue have 
not been reproduced. See Change 71 in Annex 1. 
 
2390. In practice, HMRC allow income from specific dispositions to be deducted 
from the aggregate income of the estate in calculating the residuary income of the 
estate in the year of assent and later years. But it is considered simpler for it merely to 
be excluded from what counts as the aggregate income and not be deducted from it. 
See Change 70 in Annex 1. 
 
2391. Subsection (2)(b) deals with annual payments. Because of the restricted 
meaning given to annual payments, much of the wide definition in sections 701(6) 
and 702(d) of ICTA is otiose. Any liabilities which are annual payments will now 
have to meet only the requirement that they are properly payable out of residue and 
this is also a requirement of section 701(6) of ICTA. Omitting the remainder of the 
definition removes unnecessary material. As a consequence of the change, 
section 701(7) of ICTA, which limits the meaning of &#8220;charges on residue&#8221; in relation 
to specific dispositions, does not need to be rewritten either. 
 
2392. The clause does not contain an ordering rule for allocating allowable estate 
deductions against different categories of income. It is implicit in this clause that the 
taxpayer may choose whichever allocation is most advantageous. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="950" SerialNumber="55">Clause 950: Shares of residuary income of estate 
2393. This clause explains the rules for determining the share of residuary income 
treated as arising from a company&#8217;s absolute interest in the whole or part of the 
residue of an estate. It is based on section 696(2) and (8) of ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 667 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="951" SerialNumber="56">Clause 951: Reduction in share of residuary income of estate 
2394. This clause provides that the share of the residuary income of the estate of a 
company with an absolute interest is reduced at the end of the administration period in 
certain circumstances. It is based on section 697(2) and (3) of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 668 of ITTOIA. 
 
2395. Until it was repealed by ITA 2007, section 4(1) of ICTA provided that sums 
paid during (or on completion of) the administration period were to be grossed up by 
reference to the basic rate for the tax year in which it was paid in the case of UK 
estates. Subsection (5) provides that, for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) the basic 
rate is used when grossing up these sums. See Change 72 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="952" SerialNumber="57">Clause 952: Applicable rate for determining assumed income entitlement (UK 
estates) 
2396. This clause sets out the calculation of the applicable rate for the purposes of 
calculating income tax to be deducted from the residuary income at step 2 of 
clause 948(1). The clause is based on section 701(3A) of ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 670 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="953" SerialNumber="58">Clause 953: Introduction 
2397. This clause introduces the clauses dealing with successive interests where two 
or more interests in the whole or part of the residue of an estate are held successively 
during the administration period by different persons. It is based on section 698(4) 
to (6) of ICTA. The income tax rules corresponding to subsections (2) and (3) are 
rewritten in section 671(7) and (8) of ITTOIA. 
 
2398. Subsection (3) ensures that where a previous holder is not a company within 
the charge to corporation tax, that person&#8217;s accounting periods (for the purposes of 
this clause) correspond with tax years. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="954" SerialNumber="59">Clause 954: Successive absolute interests 
2399. This clause explains the position where two or more absolute interests in the 
residue of an estate are held successively by different persons. It is based on 
sections 697(4) and (5), and 698(2) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is 
in section 671 of ITTOIA. 
 
2400. Subsection (3) contains an ordering rule to ensure that all determinations under 
subsection (2) or clause 955(2) are made in relation to the person with the earlier 
interest before the person with the later interest. This subsection has been inserted to 
make explicit what is already implicit in the source legislation. 
 
2401. Subsection (4) provides a special rule where there are two or more absolute 
interests in the final accounting period. It is intended to ensure that it is the last 
absolute interest which is charged to tax on the assumed income entitlement, which 
will comprise all the residuary income, in the final accounting period. This is because 
the last absolute interest holder will receive the capital of the residue (and also all 
outstanding income in respect of it). 
 
2402. Subsections (5) and (6) contain special rules where clause 951 (reduction in 
share of residuary income of estate) applies and there are successive absolute 
interests. These subsections provide that the calculation under clause 951(1)(a) and 
(b) is to be made by reference to all the absolute interests taken together. Then, after 
applying the reduction to the last absolute interest under clause 951(2) and (3), any 
remaining excess is applied to the previous absolute interest holders working 
backwards from the beginning of the last interest. See Change 73 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="955" SerialNumber="60">Clause 955: Assumed income entitlement of holder of absolute interest following 
limited interest 
2403. This clause and clause 956 explain the position of the absolute interest holder 
where successive limited and absolute interests in the residue of an estate are held by 
different persons. It is based on section 698(1A) and (1B) of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 672 of ITTOIA. 
 
2404. The clause applies only where the later interests arise or are created on the 
cessation of the previous interest otherwise than by death. The position of limited 
interests which cease on the death of the holder before the final tax year are dealt with 
in section 654 of ITTOIA and clause 939 of this Bill. All sums paid or remaining 
payable in respect of that interest after the tax year of death are treated as estate 
income arising in the tax year of death. 
2405. Examples of situations, in relation to limited interests, that are covered by the 
clause include: 
 
    &#8226; the disclaiming of a life interest which accelerates an existing interest under 
       the will; and 
 
    &#8226; an interest which is only held until marriage or attaining a certain age. 
 
2406. Subsections (3) and (4) contain the two rules introduced by subsection (2). 
They deal with the limited interest which ceases otherwise than on death. They also 
explain how such an interest is brought into the calculation of whether the person with 
the absolute interest has an assumed income entitlement and, if so, its amount. The 
assumed income entitlement works on a cumulative basis, so the share of the 
residuary income of the absolute interest holder and the basic amounts of previous 
accounting periods are taken into account. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="956" SerialNumber="61">Clause 956: Payments in respect of limited interests followed by absolute 
interests 
2407. This clause covers the position where the absolute interest holder is entitled to 
receive payments in respect of a preceding limited interest which has ceased 
otherwise than on death. It is based on section 698(1A) and (1B) of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 673 of ITTOIA. 
 
2408. Subsection (2) deals with such payments while the absolute interest holder still 
has the absolute interest. It provides that a payment made to the absolute interest 
holder in respect of the limited interest is treated as paid in respect of the absolute 
interest (and not the limited interest). Thus, such payments may form part of the basic 
amount of estate income in accounting periods before the final accounting period. 
 
2409. Subsection (3) deals with the position where the holder&#8217;s absolute interest has 
itself ceased (but the administration period continues). The approach here is to treat 
any such sum paid in these circumstances as a payment in respect of the earlier 
limited interest. The result is that such payments are treated as estate income under the 
limited interests provisions. But subsection (6) provides that the payments are treated 
as paid or payable in respect of the absolute interest for the purposes of clause 951 
(reduction in share of residuary income of estate). 
 
2410. The taxation of successive interests in the residue of an estate is dealt with in 
section 698(1A) to (2) of ICTA. Section 698(1B) of ICTA deals with the case where 
there were successive interests in an estate which ceased otherwise than on death and 
the earliest or one of the earlier interests was a limited interest (see section 698(1A) of 
ICTA). 
 
2411. Section 698(1B)(a) of ICTA provides that Part 16 of ICTA applies as if all the 
interests were the same interest (&#8220;the deemed single interest&#8221;), so that none of them is 
to be treated as having ceased on being succeeded by any of the others. 
Section 698(1B)(b) of ICTA then determines who had the deemed single interest. It is 
either the person in respect of whose interest or previous interest the payment was 
made (section 698(1B)(b)(i) of ICTA) or a person who has or had an interest and is 
entitled to receive the payment (section 698(1B)(b)(ii) of ICTA). So a beneficiary 
who does not give up his or her entitlement to income which is unpaid at the time the 
interest ceases is taxable on the payment, rather than the person holding the 
successive interest at the time when the payment is made. However, 
section 698(1B)(b) of ICTA is made subject to section 698(1B)(c) of ICTA. 
Section 698(1B)(c)(i) of ICTA provides that, so far as a later interest is an absolute 
interest, it is to be treated as having always existed and the earlier interest or interests 
as having never existed for the purposes of the provisions dealing with absolute 
interests in section 696(3A) to (5) of ICTA. 
 
2412. In rare circumstances the later absolute interest may itself have ceased at the 
time the payment is made. For example, A has a limited interest which is succeeded 
by absolute interests held first by B and then by C, and a payment is received by B in 
respect of A&#8217;s earlier limited interest after B&#8217;s own interest has ceased but before the 
end of the administration period. As a result of section 698(1B)(b)(ii) of ICTA, 
Part 16 of ICTA applies to the payment as if B had the deemed single interest. So 
section 696(3) of ICTA deems the sum to be paid to B as income in the accounting 
period in which it is actually paid. That is an accounting period in which C had the 
absolute interest. Under section 698(1B)(c)(i) of ICTA for the purposes of 
section 696(3A) to (5) of ICTA, Part 16 of ICTA is to apply as if the later interest of 
C had always existed and the earlier interests had never existed. 
Section 698(1B)(c)(ii) and (iii) of ICTA then provides that sums paid as income in 
respect of the earlier interests are deemed to be sums paid in respect of the later 
interest of C. 
 
2413. The relationship between these particular provisions, where the later interest 
has itself ceased at the time the payment is made but the administration period 
continues, is difficult to work out. It would seem that the payment in the above 
example should be taxed on B because of section 696(3) of ICTA. The payment is 
then brought into account when the payments made in respect of C&#8217;s interest are 
compared to its aggregated income entitlement (in making the final year calculation 
under section 696(5) of ICTA in respect of C&#8217;s interest to determine whether any 
amount should be treated as having been paid to C immediately before the end of the 
administration period). So although section 698(1A) and (1B) of ICTA operate in a 
very convoluted way in the above circumstances, the end result appears to be that B, 
the person with the absolute interest who receives the payment, is taxed on it, but it 
does not affect B&#8217;s aggregated income entitlement. 
 
2414. In order to spell out how a payment made in these circumstances should be 
treated, subsections (3) and (4) of this clause provide that where such a payment is 
made, this Chapter applies as if the earlier limited interest had continued to subsist 
while the later absolute interest subsisted and had been held by the holder of the later 
absolute interest. The result is that payments to that holder are treated as estate income 
under the provisions about limited interests. 
 
2415. Sums to which that holder is entitled that remain payable at the end of the 
administration period are treated in the same way. They will be basic amounts arising 
from the limited interest in the accounting period in which the absolute interest ceases 
and are dealt with by clauses 939 and 944. The effect of this on later absolute interests 
is then determined by the successive absolute interests provisions in clause 954. 
Under subsection (6) of this clause, however, these sums are to be treated as paid or 
payable in respect of the absolute interest for the purposes of the provisions about the 
reduction in shares of residuary income under clause 951. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="957" SerialNumber="62">Clause 957: Holders of limited interests 
2416. This clause explains the position of a limited interest holder where successive 
interests in the residue of an estate are held by different persons and the earlier, or if 
there are more than two, the earliest of the interests is a limited interest. It is based on 
sections 695(2) and (3) and 698(1A) and (1B) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 674 of ITTOIA. 
 
2417. The clause only applies where the later interests arise or are created on the 
cessation of the previous interest otherwise than by death. 
 
2418. Subsections (3) to (5) cover three sets of circumstances described as &#8220;cases&#8221; 
where the estate income in respect of successive limited interests is treated as arising. 
The cases are the equivalent for successive limited interests of the three cases for 
single limited interests in clause 939. But the clause recognises that there may be 
more than one limited interest in the chain of succession, so references are made to 
&#8220;one of the interests&#8221; and subsection (5) refers to &#8220;the last of the successive interests&#8221;. 
 
2419. There is also an additional sub-paragraph in each case providing that a limited 
holder (as defined) is entitled to receive the payment. This reflects the fact that the 
person who receives the payment in these circumstances is not always the person in 
respect of whose interest the payment is made. For example, on disclaiming a life 
interest, a beneficiary may also disclaim any entitlement to income accrued in respect 
of that interest but not yet paid. 
 
2420. The clause does not make it explicit that a new chain of succession begins 
with the first limited interest (and a previous absolute interest is ignored) for the 
purposes of this provision. Nor does the clause make it explicit that two limited 
interests which are preceded by a limited interest which ceased on the death of the 
beneficiary are covered by the clause. These conclusions are implicit in this clause. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="958" SerialNumber="63">Clause 958: Basic amount of estate income: successive limited interests 
2421. This clause explains how to calculate the net amount of estate income for 
successive limited interests. It is based on sections 695(2) to (4) and 698(1A) and (1B) 
of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 675 of ITTOIA. 
2422. The clause is the equivalent provision to clause 944 for limited interests that 
are not successive. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="959" SerialNumber="64">Clause 959: Apportionments 
2423. This clause applies where successive interests apply to only part of the residue. 
In other words, the residuary estate is divided up and one or more of the successive 
interests provisions apply to a part or parts of that estate. It also applies where one of 
the interests covers the whole estate and the other interest covers part of it. It is new. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 676 of ITTOIA. See Change 74 in 
Annex 1. 
 
2424. In such circumstances, it is possible that a subsequent interest may not cover 
exactly the same part of the residuary estate as the interest which preceded it. For 
example, limited interest holders may give up half their interest, thus accelerating the 
interest of the absolute interest holder. Only half the share of the residuary income and 
half the net amounts of the limited interest holder would be needed for the calculation 
of whether the absolute interest holder has an assumed income entitlement in 
accordance with clause 955(2). The clause provides for just and reasonable 
apportionments to be made in these circumstances. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="960" SerialNumber="65">Clause 960: Relief in respect of tax relating to absolute interests 
2425. This clause provides for relief if income, which has borne United Kingdom 
tax, arises to a company with an absolute interest in the residue of a foreign estate. It 
is based on section 696(7) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 677 of ITTOIA. 
 
2426. Subsection (2) contains the formula for calculating the relief where a claim is 
made. The labels in section 696(7)(a) and (b) of ICTA &#8211; &#8220;the deemed income&#8221; and 
&#8220;the aggregate income&#8221; respectively &#8211; were added as explanatory aids in the course of 
the ICTA consolidation. These labels are not retained. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="961" SerialNumber="66">Clause 961: Relief in respect of tax relating to limited or discretionary interests 
2427. This clause provides for relief if income, which has borne United Kingdom 
tax, arises to a company with a limited or discretionary interest in the residue of a 
foreign estate. The clause is based on sections 695(5) and 698(3) of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 678 of ITTOIA. 
 
2428. Subsection (2) provides for a reduction to be made from the tax charged on the 
company following a claim for relief. The tax is to be reduced by an amount equal to 
the appropriate fraction of that tax. The fraction here (based on section 695(5) of 
ICTA) is slightly different from the fraction used for absolute interests (based on 
section 696(7) of ICTA). The labels in section 695(5)(a) and (b) of ICTA &#8211; &#8220;the 
deemed income&#8221; and &#8220;the aggregate income&#8221; respectively &#8211; were added as 
explanatory aids in the course of the 1988 consolidation. These labels are not retained. 
2429. Section 695(6) of ICTA is not rewritten. The meaning of this provision, which 
was introduced when surtax was still charged, is now obscure and it is difficult to see 
how it could operate in the context of Self Assessment for companies. See 
Change 100 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="962" SerialNumber="67">Clause 962: Income from which basic amounts are treated as paid 
2430. This clause sets out the rules for determining from which part of the aggregate 
income of the estate a basic amount is treated as paid. It is based on sections 699A(2) 
and 701(3A) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 679 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
2431. Personal representatives may receive such income from a number of sources, 
and different rates of tax apply to different types of income. Some of the income is 
taxed in the hands of the personal representatives at &#8220;the applicable rate&#8221; (the basic 
rate or the dividend ordinary rate. See clause 963). 
 
2432. The basic amounts of estate income do not always correlate precisely to the 
income received by the personal representatives. It is therefore necessary to attribute 
payments out of the residuary estate in the form of basic amounts to particular types 
of income received by the personal representatives. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="963" SerialNumber="68">Clause 963: Income treated as bearing income tax 
2433. This clause deals with income which is treated as bearing income tax. It is 
based on section 699A of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 680 of ITTOIA. 
 
2434. Where such income forms part of the aggregate income of the estate (as a 
result of clause 947(2)), this clause treats the income as having borne tax at either the 
dividend ordinary rate or the basic rate (as appropriate) for certain provisions within 
the Chapter. 
 
2435. Section 699A(1)(b) of ICTA is not rewritten in this Bill. This provision 
provides that the sums to which section 699A(1)(a) of ICTA applies must be sums in 
respect of which the personal representatives are not directly assessable to United 
Kingdom income tax. Of the income referred to in section 699A(1)(a) of ICTA to 
which section 699A(1)(b) of ICTA applies, none appears to be directly assessable. So 
section 699A(1)(b) of ICTA serves no useful purpose. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="964" SerialNumber="69">Clause 964: Transfers of assets etc treated as payments 
2436. This clause is concerned with the appropriation of assets by personal 
representatives to themselves, any other transfer of assets and the set off or release of 
a debt. The clause is based on section 701(12) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 681 of ITTOIA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="965" SerialNumber="70">Clause 965: Assessments, adjustments and claims after the administration period 
2437. This clause deals with adjustments after the end of the administration period. It 
is based on section 700(1) to (3) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 682 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="966" SerialNumber="71">Clause 966: Power to obtain information from personal representatives and

</Clause><Clause Number="967" SerialNumber="72">Clause 967: Statements relating to estate income 
2439. This clause enables a company to request statements relating to a deceased 
person&#8217;s estate. It is based on section 700(5) and (6) of ICTA. 
 
2440. The last part of section 700(5) of ICTA that requires the statement to set out 
the matters in section 700(5)(a) to (b) separately for each part of estate income, in 
cases where different applicable rates apply, has not been rewritten. This requirement 
is considered unnecessary because the requirement to show amounts separately must 
occur in order for subsection 967(1)(b) of this clause to be satisfied. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="968" SerialNumber="73">Clause 968: Meaning of &#8220;personal representatives&#8221;

section 701(4) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="4" SerialNumber="74">Chapter 4: Income from holding an office 
Overview 
2442. Section 9 of ICTA applies income tax law and practice to the charge and 
calculation of corporation tax and has been amended by ITEPA, ITTOIA and ITA in 
the course of the separation of corporation tax from income tax. (See the commentary 
on Chapter 1 of Part 2.) 
 
2443. After this Bill is enacted the only context in which the principle underlying 
section 9 of ICTA will continue to be relevant is the charge to corporation tax on 
income from the holding of an office: this corporation tax charge still operates by 
reference to income tax. 
 
<Clause Number="969" SerialNumber="75">Clause 969: Charge to tax on income from holding an office 
2444. This clause applies &#8220;the charge to corporation tax on income&#8221; to income from 
an office. It is based on section 9 of ICTA. The charge on income is explained in 
clause 2. 
 
2445. Section 9(3)(b) of ICTA was amended by ITEPA and refers to employment, 
pension and social security income. Previously section 9(3) referred to &#8220;the like 
Schedules and Cases&#8221;. As a company cannot be an employee and cannot receive 
pension and social security income, these aspects of section 9(3)(b) have not been 
rewritten. Employment income however includes income from holding an office. A 
company can hold an office - a common example is as a company secretary - so this 
clause rewrites that aspect of the source legislation. 
 
2446. Under subsection (2) the amount of income from an office charged to tax is 
determined in accordance with income tax law and practice and under subsection (4) 
the provisions of ITEPA govern the calculation of the income from this source. The 
clause uses &#8220;calculated&#8221; for &#8220;computed&#8221;. 
 
2447. Subsection (3) provides that subsection (2) is subject to provisions of the 
Corporation Tax Acts. The Corporation Tax Acts are defined in section 831(1)(a) of 
ICTA as &#8220;enactments relating to the taxation of the income and chargeable gains of 
companies and of company distributions (including provisions relating also to income 
tax)&#8221;. In section 9(1) of ICTA the reference is to &#8220;the Tax Acts&#8221;. The reference has 
been narrowed since the qualifications to subsection (2) of this clause only occur in 
corporation tax enactments. 
 
2448. Section 9(2A) of ICTA which provided that for corporation tax purposes no 
income shall be computed under ITTOIA will be spent when this Bill is enacted and is 
repealed. 
 
2449. Section 9(4) of ICTA expands upon section 9(1). The part of this subsection 
that applies an exemption in an Income Tax Act (other than ITTOIA and ITA) has 
been rewritten in subsection (4)(b), since it is not absolutely certain that exemptions 
are covered by subsections (1) to (3) of this clause. 
 
2450. The other part of section 9(4) that provides for any provision of the Income 
Tax Acts (again other than ITTOIA and ITA) which charges any amount to income 
tax to have like effect for corporation tax has not been rewritten since the 
determination of the charge is covered by subsections (1) to (2) of this clause (and in 
the context of employment income in ITEPA free standing charges are not believed to 
be an issue). 
 
2451. Section 9(5) of ICTA applies &#8220;where, by virtue of this section or otherwise&#8221; 
any enactment applies both to corporation tax and income tax. This provision is 
amended by this Bill but is not repealed since it could have an application to an 
enactment that is not being rewritten. 
 
2452.   Section 9(6) of ICTA is repealed since it no longer serves a useful purpose. 
 
2453. The interpretation of &#8220;office&#8221; in subsection (6) is based on section 5(3) of 
ITEPA. The ITEPA provision derives from the cases of Great Western Railway 
Company v Bater (1922), 8 TC 231 and Edwards v Clinch (1981), 56 TC 367. This 
accords with the application of income tax principles in subsection (2) based on 
section 9(1) of ICTA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="970" SerialNumber="76">Clause 970: Rule restricting deductions for bad debts 
2454. This clause deals with bad debts arising from the holding of an office. It is 
based on section 88D of ICTA. 
 
2455. The corresponding rule about trade debts is in clause 55. 
 
2456. This clause is needed because section 88D(4) of ICTA imports the extended 
meaning of &#8220;trade&#8221; in section 6(4) of ICTA. So the ICTA rule applies to a vocation 
and also to an office or employment. In this Bill, for corporation tax purposes a 
company cannot carry on a vocation or be employed. 
 
2457. Subsection (1) excludes from the rule any debts that are dealt with by the loan 
relationship rules in Parts 5 and 6 of the Bill. Section 88D(1) of ICTA also excludes 
debts that are dealt with by the rules for derivative contracts and intangible fixed 
assets. Those rules are not relevant to an office-holder and so are not mentioned in the 
clause. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="5" SerialNumber="77">Chapter 5: Distributions from unauthorised unit trusts 
Overview 
2458. This Chapter applies the charge to corporation tax on income to payments to 
companies from unauthorised unit trusts. It is based on section 469 of ICTA. The 
corresponding income tax provisions are in Chapter 10 of Part 4 of ITTOIA. 
 
<Clause Number="971" SerialNumber="78">Clause 971: Overview of Chapter 
2459. This clause sets out how relevant amounts are calculated and charged to 
corporation tax. It also points to particular provisions of ITA and of ICTA which deal 
with the position of a unit holder. It is new. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="972" SerialNumber="79">Clause 972: Charge to tax under this Chapter 
2460. This clause applies the charge to corporation tax on income to amounts shown 
in the unit trust scheme&#8217;s accounts as income available for payment to unit holders or 
for investment in the scheme. It is based on sections 9, 18 and 469 of ICTA. The 
corresponding charge for income tax is in section 547 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="973" SerialNumber="80">Clause 973: Amount of income treated as received 
2461. This clause sets out the amount of income treated as received by a unit holder 
from an unauthorised unit trust scheme under clause 972(2). It is based on section 469 
of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 548 of ITTOIA. 
 
2462. Subsection (2) contains a method statement setting out the steps to be taken to 
calculate the gross amount of income on which the unit holder is charged to tax. 
Chapter 6: Sales of foreign dividend coupons 
Overview 
2463. This Chapter rewrites the charge to tax in section 18(3B) to (3E) of ICTA on 
the proceeds of the sale of coupons attached to foreign shares, where the sale is made 
through a bank in the United Kingdom or to a dealer in coupons in the United 
Kingdom. 
 
2464. Although these provisions include coupons on both securities and shares, for 
corporation tax purposes the charge applies in effect to the sale of coupons on shares 
only. 
 
2465. Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 1996 charges to tax all profits and gains arising to a 
company from its loan relationships. Profits and gains include (section 81(5) 
and 84(1) of that Act) payments payable in pursuance of any rights under a loan 
relationship. The sale of a coupon on a security is charged to tax in the same way as 
any sale in pursuance of a right under a loan relationship. Section 18(3B) of ICTA as 
it applies to coupons on securities is therefore unnecessary for corporation tax 
purposes and section 80(5) of FA 1996 applies to give the loan relationship provisions 
precedence in any event. 
 
2466. Section 18(3B) of ICTA requires Schedule D Case IV in section 18(3) to be 
read as including proceeds of the sales of coupons for foreign dividends. 
Subsection (3B) does not explain how the charge is allocated between Schedule D 
Case IV and Case V. The obvious assumption is that where the coupon is issued in 
respect of a security out of the United Kingdom it falls within Case IV (which charges 
income from overseas securities) and otherwise within Case V (which charges income 
from possessions outside the United Kingdom). 
 
2467. Section 18(3A) of ICTA requires &#8220;Case III&#8221; as set out in that subsection to be 
substituted for &#8220;Case IV&#8221; in section 18(3) of ICTA. The effect of this is to bring the 
extended meaning of Case IV required by section 18(3B) of ICTA into a Case III 
charge which incorporates a charge under the loan relationships provisions which, as 
explained above, already charges to tax the sale of coupons in respect of securities. 
 
2468. Whether or not it was intentional that a Case IV charge for corporation tax 
should remain within section 18(3B) to (3E) of ICTA to be brought within Case III by 
section 18(3A) of ICTA is unclear. Subsections (3B) to (3E) were introduced in 
FA 1996, the same Finance Act that introduced section 18(3A) of ICTA. Either way 
the effect of section 18(3B) to (3E) of ICTA is simply to bring within the loan 
relationships provisions the sale of coupons on securities even though they are already 
within the provisions on first principles. 
 
2469. For these reasons section 18(3B) to (3E) of ICTA has been rewritten to 
exclude the sales of coupons on foreign securities. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="974" SerialNumber="81">Clause 974: Charge to tax under this Chapter 
2470. This clause applies the charge to corporation tax to income which is treated as 
arising from foreign holdings where a dividend coupon attached to the holding is (a) 
sold or otherwise realised by a bank in the United Kingdom or (b) sold to a coupon 
dealer in the United Kingdom by someone other than a bank or a coupon dealer. It is 
based on section 18(3), (3B) and (3E) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income 
tax is in section 570 of ITTOIA. 
 
2471. Subsection (3) applies where the coupon is sold by the bank on behalf of 
another. See Change 75 in Annex 1. 
 
2472. Subsection (4) applies where a person who is neither a bank nor another 
coupon dealer sells the dividend coupons to a coupon dealer in the United Kingdom. 
Section 18(3B)(b) of ICTA refers to a dealer in coupons in the United Kingdom. See 
Change 75 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="975" SerialNumber="82">Clause 975: Meaning of &#8220;foreign holdings&#8221; etc 
2473. This clause gives the meaning of &#8220;foreign holdings&#8221; and &#8220;dividend coupons&#8221;. 
It is based on section 18(3B), (3C), (3D) and (3E) of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 571 of ITTOIA. 
 
2474. For reasons given above the extended definition of &#8220;dividends&#8221; to include 
interest or other annual payments has been omitted as part of the exclusion of coupons 
in respect of securities. It is considered that &#8220;dividends&#8221; alone in section 18(3D) of 
ICTA is sufficient to refer to any income from shares. 
 
2475. The definition in subsection (1) of &#8220;foreign holdings&#8221; as shares outside the 
United Kingdom which are issued by or on behalf of a non-UK resident body of 
persons reflects the wording of section 18(3C) of ICTA. Section 18(3B) states that the 
references in Schedule D Cases IV and V to income arising from securities or 
possessions out of the UK are to be taken in the case of relevant foreign holdings as 
including the various categories of proceeds detailed under paragraphs (a) and (b). 
This is construed as meaning that where the securities or possessions are out of the 
United Kingdom and are relevant foreign holdings references to income from them 
include the proceeds under those paragraphs (but not in other cases). In other words 
there is no assumption of a complete overlap between securities or possessions out of 
the United Kingdom and relevant foreign holdings. Whether a security or possession 
is within Cases IV and V as a security or possession out of the United Kingdom may 
depend on a number of factors (see Westminster Bank Executor and Trustee Co 
(Channel Islands) Ltd v National Bank of Greece SA (1970), 46 TC 472 HL). 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="7" SerialNumber="83">Chapter 7: Annual payments not otherwise charged 
Overview 
2476. The Chapter sets out the charge to corporation tax on income on any annual 
payments that are not charged to tax by any other provision of this Bill or any other 
legislation. It is based on the part of section 18 Schedule D Case III (b) of ICTA 
which deals with annual payments and the part of section 18 Schedule D Case V of 
ICTA which deals with foreign annual payments. The corresponding rules for income 
tax are in Chapter 7 of Part 5 of ITTOIA. 
 
2477. Annuity payments made under purchased life annuities and distributions from 
unauthorised unit trusts (which in the source legislation are treated as annual 
payments) are generally regarded as investment income. A company which is the 
recipient of a payment under a purchased life annuity contract is deemed to be a party 
to a creditor relationship (see clauses 561 and 562 of this Bill). The application of the 
charge to corporation tax on income for distributions from unauthorised unit trusts is 
in clause 972 of this Bill. As the application of the charge to corporation tax on 
income for annual payments in this Chapter takes effect only if an amount is not 
otherwise charged to corporation tax, there is no overlap between the various 
provisions. 
 
2478. The phrase &#8220;annual payment&#8221; is retained but is not defined in the Bill or in the 
source legislation. Instead it derives its meaning from an extensive body of case law. 
That case law illustrates that the phrase has a meaning for tax purposes far different 
from its natural one. Replacing that phrase would risk breaking the link to case law 
without making the law any clearer or easier to understand. 
 
<Clause Number="976" SerialNumber="84">Clause 976: Overview of Chapter 
2479. This clause provides an overview of the Chapter and signposts other relevant 
provisions. It is new. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="977" SerialNumber="85">Clause 977: Charge to tax on annual payments not otherwise charged 
2480. This clause applies the charge to corporation tax on income to annual 
payments not charged elsewhere. It is based on sections 9 and 18 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 683 of ITTOIA. 
 
2481. Subsection (1) applies the charge to corporation tax on income to residual 
annual payments. The charge to tax in the source legislation is in respect of &#8220;any 
annuity or other annual payment&#8221;. The reference to &#8220;any annuity or other&#8221; is omitted 
because most annuities are charged to tax not under this Chapter but under Part 5 
(loan relationships). Including a reference to annuities might therefore be misleading. 
 
2482. The words &#8220;whether inside or outside the United Kingdom&#8221; in Schedule D 
Case III (b) are also omitted. The place of payment is only one of a number of factors 
derived from case law which may be taken into account in determining the source of 
annual payments. 
 
2483. The source legislation excludes &#8220;any payment chargeable under Schedule A&#8221;. 
It is not necessary to rewrite this as clauses 209, 270, 277 and 280 apply the charge to 
corporation tax on income to property income. 
2484. Subsection (2) ensures that any exemption resulting from the application of the 
charge to corporation tax on income to other income is not reversed by the application 
of that charge under this Chapter. 
 
2485. Subsection (3) rewrites &#8220;or whether annually or at shorter or longer intervals&#8221;. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="978" SerialNumber="86">Clause 978: Exemption for payments by persons liable to pool betting duty 
2486. This clause gives an exemption from corporation tax for annual payments 
made by persons liable to pool betting duty. It is based on section 126 of FA 1990 and 
section 121 of FA 1991. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 748 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
2487. The exemption applies to payments made in consequence of a reduction in 
pool betting duty, whenever that reduction is made (see subsection (2)). 
Subsection (2) combines the conditions in FA 1990 and FA 1991. Although the 
source legislation is restricted to the 1990 and 1991 reductions in pool betting duty, 
the subsection applies to payments made &#8220;in consequence of&#8221; any reduction in the 
duty. See Change 36 in Annex 1. 
 
2488. Subsection (3) sets out a further condition which needs to be satisfied. The 
subsection does not specify that payments in consequence of the 1990 reduction in 
pool betting duty must be paid for football safety and comfort (see section 126(3) of 
FA 1990) or that payments in consequence of the 1991 reduction must be paid to the 
Foundation for Sport and the Arts (see section 121(3) of FA 1991). Instead the 
subsection applies to a payment in consequence of any reduction in pool betting duty 
for either purpose. See Change 35 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="8" SerialNumber="87">Chapter 8: Income not otherwise charged 
Overview 
2489. This Chapter applies the charge to corporation tax on income to any income 
that is not so charged by any other corporation tax provision. The corresponding 
income tax charge is in Chapter 8 of Part 5 of ITTOIA. 
 
2490. The Chapter also includes exemptions from the charge applied under this 
Chapter. 
 
2491. In the source legislation, Schedule D is the residual Schedule into which 
income falls for corporation tax purposes if neither ITEPA nor Schedule A applies to 
it. The Schedule is set out in section 18 of ICTA. Section 18(1)(a) of ICTA charges 
&#8220;annual profits or gains arising or accruing&#8230; from any kind of property whatever&#8230;&#8221;. 
Section 18(1)(b) of ICTA charges &#8220;&#8230;other annual profits or gains not charged under 
Schedule A or under ITEPA 2003 as employment income, pension income or social 
security income, and not specially exempted from tax&#8221;. 
 
2492. Schedule D Case VI is itself the residual Case under that Schedule. Tax is 
charged under Case VI &#8220;in respect of annual profits or gains not falling under any 
other Case of Schedule D and not charged by virtue of Schedule A or by virtue of 
ITEPA 2003 as employment income, pension income or social security income&#8221;. 
Schedule D Case V includes an identical function for the income to which that Case 
applies. The scope of Case V is (subject to the override in section 18(3A) of ICTA 
giving priority to Schedule D Case III in respect of anything chargeable under 
Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 1996 as profits or gains from loan relationships) &#8220;income 
arising from possessions out of the United Kingdom not being employment income, 
pension income or social security income on which tax is charged under 
ITEPA 2003&#8221;. Case law has established the comprehensive scope of Case V in 
relation to &#8220;income from possessions out of the United Kingdom&#8221;. So far as any 
amount is &#8220;income from possessions out of the United Kingdom&#8221;, Case V is the &#8220;last 
resort&#8221; charging provision, not Case VI. And a corollary to that rule is that income 
charged by Case VI (other than deemed income which is directed by provisions other 
than section 18 of ICTA to be taxed under Case VI) can only derive from a source in 
the United Kingdom. 
 
2493. This Chapter brings together the &#8220;sweep up&#8221; functions of Schedule D Cases V 
and VI. 
 
2494. The charge under this Chapter is restricted to amounts that are &#8220;income&#8221; on 
first principles. That is, in terms of the source legislation they are &#8220;annual profits or 
gains&#8221; under section 18(1) of ICTA, as that phrase has been interpreted by case law, 
and do not include profits or gains of a capital nature even if such profits are directed 
to be charged to tax as income. 
 
2495. Under section 396 of ICTA, Schedule D Case VI losses may be set against 
Case VI profits or gains. Although that relief is not rewritten in this Bill, 
consequential amendments of ICTA in Schedule 1 to this Bill ensure that the relief 
continues to work as before in respect of income within this Chapter despite the 
abolition by this Bill of the Schedules and the Cases of Schedule D. 
 
<Clause Number="979" SerialNumber="88">Clause 979: Charge to tax on income not otherwise charged 
2496. This clause applies the charge to corporation tax on income to income not so 
charged elsewhere. It is based on sections 9(1), (2), (2B), (2C), (3) and (4) and 18(1) 
and (3) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 687 of ITTOIA. 
 
2497. Schedule D Case V charges tax in respect of income from possessions out of 
the United Kingdom. Schedule D Case VI charges tax in respect of annual profits or 
gains. The scope of both Cases is derived from section 18(1) of ICTA, which refers to 
&#8220;annual profits or gains&#8221;. Case law does not indicate a difference, in the context of 
section 18 of ICTA, in the meaning of &#8220;annual profits or gains&#8221; and &#8220;income&#8221;. The 
choice of term appears to be dictated (although not consistently) by the degree to 
which a calculation of profit or loss is relevant to the calculation of the income 
charged. The clause uses income rather than (annual) profits or gains. 
2498. Subsection (2) protects the effect of any exemption, whether provided by this 
Chapter or by Part 19 (general exemptions) of this Bill or by other legislation. 
 
2499. That subsection disapplies the charge to &#8220;deemed income&#8221;. This term refers to 
amounts that are treated as income by a provision of the Corporation Tax Acts, so that 
the charge to corporation tax on income applies to that amount. The disapplication 
applies in the event that such deemed income would not fall within any other 
application of the charge to corporation tax on income. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="980" SerialNumber="89">Clause 980: Exemption for commercial occupation of woodlands in UK 
2500. This clause exempts income arising from the occupation of commercial 
woodlands from any charge under this Chapter. It is based on paragraphs 2 and 3 of 
Schedule 6 to FA 1988. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 768 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
2501. A consequence of this exemption is that no loss relief is available under 
section 396 of ICTA (losses from miscellaneous transactions). A requirement of that 
section is that any profit on the transaction would be liable to corporation tax. 
 
2502. This clause is complemented by clauses 37 and 208 of this Bill. The combined 
effect of these three clauses is that income from the occupation of commercial 
woodlands is ignored for corporation tax purposes. 
 
2503. The interpretation of commercial occupation of woodlands in subsection (2) is 
supplemented by the definition of &#8220;woodlands&#8221; in clause 1317(4) of this Bill. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="981" SerialNumber="90">Clause 981: Exemption for gains on financial futures 
2504. This section removes gains on financial futures, traded options and financial 
options from the charge to corporation tax on income under this Chapter. It is based 
on section 128 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 779 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
2505. Because of this exemption, the gains in question (which do not include any 
gains falling within Part 3 (trading income)) are not charged to corporation tax as 
income but as chargeable gains (see section 143 of TCGA). 
 
2506. In contrast to the equivalent income tax exemption (section 779 of ITTOIA), 
this exemption does not cover commodity futures. Commodity futures come within 
the scope of the derivative contracts regime rather than the chargeable gains rules (see 
Part 7 of this Bill). To the extent that any of the futures or options to which this 
exemption would otherwise apply are also within the scope of that Part, this 
exemption will not apply. See the definition of a &#8220;derivative contract&#8221; in clause 576. 
 
2507. The section imports the definitions provided by section 143 of TCGA. The 
definition of &#8220;recognised futures exchange&#8221; is provided because, unlike the position in 
ITTOIA (see section 558(3) of that Act), there is no definition of the term elsewhere 
in this Bill that applies here. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="9" SerialNumber="91">Chapter 9: Priority rules 
<Clause Number="982" SerialNumber="92">Clause 982: Provisions which must be given priority over this Part 
2508. This clause determines which Part takes priority in the event of an overlap of 
the charge on the profits of a trade or the profits of a UK property business and a 
charge under a Chapter of this Part. It is based on section 18(1), (2) and (3) of ICTA. 
The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 261 of ITTOIA. 
 
2509. In the case of such an overlap, priority is given to the charge under Part 3 
(trading income) or Part 4 (property income), as the case may be. 
 
2510. Subsection (1) gives statutory effect to the Crown Option as regards the 
overlap between income charged under another Case of Schedule D and income of a 
United Kingdom trade charged under Schedule D Case I. See Change 55 in Annex 1. 
 
2511. Subsection (2) is based on the definition of the Cases of Schedule D in 
section 18 of ICTA so far as it gives priority to the charge under Schedule A. 
 
</Clause></Chapter></Part><Part Number="11" SerialNumber="93">Part 11: Relief for particular employee share acquisition schemes 
Overview 
2512. This Part and Part 12 give specific statutory deductions for various costs 
associated with setting up and operating employee share schemes. These are 
arrangements under which employers provide incentives for their employees in the 
form of shares. This Part gives relief for the provision of shares under an approved 
share incentive plan. It also gives relief for the cost of setting up particular types of 
approved share scheme. It is based on sections 84A and 85A of ICTA and 
Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2513. Neither Part 11 nor Part 12 gives relief for the day to day costs of running a 
scheme. These must be considered according to the ordinary rules that apply to the 
calculation of business profits for corporation tax purposes. Those rules also apply if 
relief is not available under either of these Parts for the costs of setting up a scheme or 
providing the shares under the scheme. 
 
2514. The rule in clause 53 in Part 3 (trading income), that prevents a deduction for 
items of a capital nature, is subject to contrary provision. This avoids a conflict 
between that general rule and, in the context of this Part, the specific relief given by 
some clauses of this Part. For example, the cost of setting up a SIP would normally be 
considered to be capital expenditure. 
 
<Chapter Number="1" SerialNumber="94">Chapter 1: Share incentive plans 
<Clause Number="983" SerialNumber="95">Clause 983: Overview of Chapter 
2515. This clause introduces the provisions within the Chapter. It is new. 
2516. The Chapter gives a deduction for the costs of setting up an approved share 
incentive plan (SIP) and for the provision of shares under the SIP. The qualifying 
conditions for approval of the SIP itself are in Schedule 2 to ITEPA and this Chapter 
is treated as part of the SIP code. See clause 984. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="984" SerialNumber="96">Clause 984: Chapter to form part of SIP code etc 
2517. This clause provides that this Chapter forms part of the SIP code. The clause 
also deals with the trustees&#8217; acquisition of forfeited shares. It is based on paragraphs 1 
and 6 of Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2518. Subsection (2) makes clear that a consequence of treating the Chapter as part 
of the SIP code is that the definitions in Schedule 2 to ITEPA apply to the Chapter. 
 
2519. Subsection (4) deals with the trustees&#8217; acquisition of forfeited shares. The plan 
rules may require an employee to forfeit his or her plan shares if the employee leaves 
the company. No further deduction is allowed to the company if the forfeited shares 
are re-awarded. See clause 996 exclusion 5. But it may be necessary to identify 
whether these shares are included in a later award. See, for example, clause 994(6)(b). 
Subsection (4) identifies when forfeited shares are acquired for this purpose. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="985" SerialNumber="97">Clause 985: References to a deduction being allowed to a company 
2520. This clause explains how a deduction allowed by this Chapter is given to 
companies carrying on different types of business. It is based on paragraphs 1 and 13 
of Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2521. Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 4AA to ICTA allows a deduction in calculating 
trade profits. Section 21A of ICTA applies this rule to the calculation of the profits of 
a property business. These deductions are dealt with in subsection (2). 
 
2522. A property business may also be an investment business. Subsection (3) makes 
specific provision for a company with investment business. The deduction is allowed 
as an expense of management (see Chapter 2 of Part 16). 
 
2523. If the business is both a property business and an investment business 
subsection (3) gives priority to subsection (2). This priority is based on section 75(2) 
of ICTA which provides that a deduction as an expense of management is not given if 
the deduction is otherwise allowable. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="986" SerialNumber="98">Clause 986: Treatment of receipts under Chapter 
2524. This clause explains how a withdrawal of relief is taxed. It is based on 
section 21A of, and paragraphs 10 to 13 of Schedule 4AA to, ICTA. 
 
2525. If relief is withdrawn the company is treated as receiving an amount equal to 
the deduction. See, for example, clause 990(4). This clause sets out how this is taxed. 
2526. Subsection (3) applies if the relief is recovered after the trade or property 
business has ceased. It makes clear that the recoveries are taxed as post-cessation 
receipts. In the source legislation the amounts are taxed as trading receipts. See 
Change 76 in Annex 1. This change also affects clauses 990(4) and (5), 992(4) 
and (6), 993(2) and (4) and 998(3) and (4). 
 
2527. If the company is not carrying on a trade or property business or has not 
carried on a trade or property business the amount is one to which the charge to 
corporation tax on income is applied, see subsection (4). 
 
2528. This treatment is also applied to the recovery of relief given for contributions 
to a plan trust. In the source legislation paragraphs 10 and 12 of Schedule 4AA to 
ICTA charge these amounts as trade receipts. See Change 76 in Annex 1. 
 
2529. The amount charged by subsection (4) is included on the list of former 
Schedule D Case VI charges (in section 834A of ICTA as inserted by Part 1 of 
Schedule 1 to this Bill). This does not mean that loss relief is available under 
section 396 of ICTA against the amount charged by subsection (4). This is because 
the amount charged by subsection (4) does not arise from a transaction as required by 
that section. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="987" SerialNumber="99">Clause 987: Deduction for costs of setting up an approved share incentive plan 
2530. This clause gives a deduction for the costs setting up a SIP. It is based on 
paragraph 7 of Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2531. Subsection (4) applies if there is a delay between the company incurring the 
costs and the SIP being approved. The deduction is given for the period of account in 
which the scheme is approved. This avoids the company having to amend its company 
tax return for the period in which the expenditure was incurred or in an extreme case 
being outside the time limit for amending that return. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="988" SerialNumber="100">Clause 988: Deductions for running expenses of an approved share incentive 
plan 
2532. This clause prevents any prohibitive rule in this Chapter denying a deduction 
for the costs of running a SIP. It is based on paragraph 8 of Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2533. The trustees of a SIP will incur costs related to the day to day running of the 
SIP. For example, they will have to operate a PAYE scheme to deal with the 
employees&#8217; income tax liabilities. They will also incur incidental costs in acquiring 
the shares. The employing company will have to meet these costs. 
 
2534. The clause does not itself give the company a deduction for payments made to 
the trustees to enable them to meet the running costs. It provides that none of the 
prohibitive rules in this Chapter, such as clause 994(7), prevents a deduction being 
given for running expenses. As the SIP is run for the benefit of its employees the costs 
would usually be allowed as a normal deduction in calculating the company&#8217;s taxable 
profits. Whether or not a deduction is allowed is considered on first principles. 
 
2535. Subsection (3) makes clear that running expenses do not include the cost of 
acquiring the shares except for the incidental costs listed in subsection (4). The 
reference to stamp duty reserve tax is new. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="989" SerialNumber="101">Clause 989: Deduction for contribution to plan trust 
2536. This clause allows a deduction for a payment to the trustees which they use to 
buy shares for later award under the SIP. It is based on paragraphs 9 and 10 of 
Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2537. In broad terms the purpose of this clause is to give the company a deduction at 
the time when it funds the purchase of the shares and not when the shares are awarded 
to the employee. Without this clause it could be difficult for companies to finance the 
purchase of shares in advance of them being awarded. 
 
2538. The clause applies to payments made on or after 6 April 2003. This 
commencement is preserved in Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings). 
 
2539. &#8220;Plan trust&#8221; has the meaning given in paragraph 71(3) of Schedule 2 to 
ITEPA. 
 
2540. Subsection (2) provides that at the end of the period of 12 months beginning 
when the trustees make the acquisition with the payment the trustees must hold at 
least 10% of the ordinary share capital of the company in which the shares are 
acquired. This total applies to all the shares held. There is no requirement that the total 
is made up of shares acquired using the payment. 
 
2541. Under the SIP rules shares will be appropriated to an employee but the 
employee is required to leave the shares with the trustees. For example, 
paragraph 36(1) of Schedule 2 to ITEPA requires free shares to remain in the hands of 
the trustees for a holding period of at least three years. Subsection (3) makes clear that 
these shares count towards the 10% total. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="990" SerialNumber="102">Clause 990: Withdrawal of deduction under section 989 
2542. This clause withdraws the relief given by clause 989 if the shares acquired 
with the payment are not awarded within specified time limits. It is based on 
paragraph 10 of Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2543. Subsection (4) provides that the relief is withdrawn by treating the deduction 
as an amount received by the company. This amount is taxed in accordance with the 
rules in clause 986. 
 
2544. This clause refers to a deduction being given under clause 989. It is possible 
that the deduction may have been given under paragraph 9 of Schedule 4AA to ICTA 
if the relief was given in an accounting period before this Bill took effect. The general 
continuity of law provisions in Schedule 1 to this Bill provide that where necessary 
references to the new legislation should be read as applying also to the source 
legislation. So the recovery provisions still apply. 
 
2545. This clause contains a change to clarify and make more consistent the way in 
which withdrawn relief is treated. See Change 76 in Annex 1 and the commentary on 
clause 986. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="991" SerialNumber="103">Clause 991: Another deduction to be allowed if all acquired shares are awarded 
2546. This clause allows a further deduction if the relief is withdrawn under 
clause 990 but all the acquired shares are awarded at a later date. It is based on 
paragraph 10 of Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="992" SerialNumber="104">Clause 992: Award of shares to excluded employee 
2547. This clause withdraws a proportion of the relief given under clauses 989 
and 991 if shares are awarded to an excluded employee. It is based on paragraph 10 of 
Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2548. The definition of excluded employee in subsection (2) is the same as that in 
paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 4AA to ICTA which is rewritten as Exclusion 1 in 
clause 996. 
 
2549. This clause contains a change to clarify and make more consistent the way in 
which withdrawn relief is treated. See Change 76 in Annex 1 and the commentary on 
clause 986. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="993" SerialNumber="105">Clause 993: Termination plan notice 
2550. This clause withdraws a proportion of the relief given by clause 989 if the 
company terminates the SIP before all the shares have been awarded. It is based on 
paragraph 12 to Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2551. This clause contains a change to clarify and make more consistent the way in 
which withdrawn relief is treated. See Change 76 in Annex 1 and the commentary on 
clause 986. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="994" SerialNumber="106">Clause 994: Deduction for providing free or matching shares 
2552. This clause gives a deduction for providing free or matching shares. It is based 
on paragraph 2 of Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2553. A &#8220;free share&#8221; is defined in paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 2 to ITEPA. It 
means a share appropriated to the employee without payment. 
 
2554. A &#8220;matching share&#8221; is defined in paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 2 to ITEPA. It 
means a share appropriated to the employee without payment in proportion to the 
partnership shares acquired by the employee. 
2555. A &#8220;group plan&#8221; is defined in paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 to ITEPA. It means a 
SIP established by a parent company in which the companies it controls are allowed 
to participate. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="995" SerialNumber="107">Clause 995: Deduction for additional expense in providing partnership shares 
2556. This clause gives a deduction for any contribution the company makes towards 
the acquisition of partnership shares. It is based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 4AA to 
ICTA. 
 
2557. A &#8220;partnership share&#8221; is defined in paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 2 to ITEPA. 
It means a share acquired by the trustees on behalf of an employee out of sums 
deducted from the employee&#8217;s salary. 
 
2558. This clause is concerned with the case to which paragraph 52 of Schedule 2 to 
ITEPA applies. Partnership shares are acquired by the trustees with funds provided by 
the employee. The rules of the SIP may require the employee to make payments to the 
trustees over an accumulation period which cannot last longer than twelve months. 
Paragraph 52(3) of Schedule 2 to ITEPA provides the number of partnership shares 
awarded to the employee is calculated at the end of the accumulation period by 
reference to the lower of: 
 
    &#8226; the market value of the shares at the beginning of the period; or 
 
    &#8226; the market value of the shares on the date on which they are to be acquired. 
 
2559. If the market value of the shares at the end of the period is greater than the 
value at the beginning the company will make up the difference. This clause gives the 
company a deduction for the excess. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="996" SerialNumber="108">Clause 996: Shares excluded from sections 994 and 995 
2560. This clause identifies the shares that do not qualify for relief if they are 
awarded as free, matching or partnership shares. It is based on paragraphs 4, 6 and 9 
of Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2561. Exclusion 1 is similar to the exclusion in clause 992(2). It requires the 
employee to whom the shares are awarded to be within the charge to income tax on 
any earnings from the employment in respect of which the shares were awarded. 
Generally, it has the effect of excluding any shares awarded to non-UK resident 
employees. 
 
2562. Exclusion 2 is intended to protect the employee by acting as a disincentive to 
the award of shares that are intended to reduce in value. 
 
2563. Exclusion 3 applies if the company or an associated company operates another 
share scheme, including another SIP, and has already had a deduction for the cost of 
providing the shares for use by that scheme. As shares are not identifiable 
individually, rules are needed to identify when the shares included in an award were 
acquired. Subsection (6)(b) identifies whether shares included in an award have 
already had relief under another SIP or share scheme. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="997" SerialNumber="109">Clause 997: No deduction for expenses in providing dividend shares 
2564. This clause provides that no deduction is allowed for the cost of providing 
dividend shares. It is based on paragraph 5 of Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2565. The expression &#8220;dividend shares&#8221; is defined in paragraph 62(3)(b) of 
Schedule 2 to ITEPA. They are shares acquired by the trustees reinvesting cash 
dividends declared on plan shares the trustees hold on behalf of employees 
participating in the SIP. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="998" SerialNumber="110">Clause 998: Withdrawal of deductions if approval for share incentive plan 
withdrawn 
2566. This clause withdraws any deduction given under this Chapter if approval for 
the SIP is withdrawn. It is based on paragraph 11 of Schedule 4AA to ICTA. 
 
2567. Paragraph 83 of Schedule 2 to ITEPA allows an officer of Revenue and 
Customs to issue a notice to the company withdrawing approval of a SIP. If approval 
is withdrawn a separate notice must be issued under subsection (2) of this clause to 
recover any relief given under this Chapter. 
 
2568. The relief is withdrawn by treating the company as receiving an amount equal 
to the amount of the deduction. Clause 986 sets out how this amount is taxed. 
 
2569. This clause contains a change to clarify and make more consistent the way in 
which withdrawn relief is treated. See Change 76 in Annex 1 and the commentary on 
clause 986. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="2" SerialNumber="111">Chapter 2: SAYE option schemes, Company share option schemes and Employee 
share options trusts 
<Clause Number="999" SerialNumber="112">Clause 999: Deduction for costs of setting up SAYE option scheme or CSOP 
scheme 
2570. This clause allows a deduction for the costs of setting up an approved &#8220;save as 
you earn&#8221; (SAYE) option scheme or an approved &#8220;company share option plan&#8221; 
(CSOP) scheme. It is based on sections 21A, 75 and 84A of ICTA. 
 
2571. A CSOP scheme is commonly known as a company share option plan. 
 
2572. The clause is very similar to clauses 987 and 1000. The deduction is given in 
calculating the trade or property business profits, subsection (3), or as an expense of 
managing an investment business, subsection (4). If the business is both an investment 
business and a property business subsection (4) gives priority to the property business. 
This order of priority is based on section 75(2) of ICTA which provides that a 
deduction as an expense of management is not given if the deduction is otherwise 
allowable. 
 
2573. Subsection (6) applies if there is a delay between the company incurring the 
costs and the scheme being approved. The deduction is given for the period of account 
in which the scheme is approved. This avoids the company having to amend its 
company tax return for the period in which the expenditure is incurred or in an 
extreme case being outside the time limit for amending that return. 
 
2574. Relief for providing the shares under the schemes is given by Part 12, which 
rewrites Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2575. A CSOP can be set up by a non-UK resident company which trades in the 
United Kingdom otherwise than through a permanent establishment. Such a non-UK 
resident company would be subject to income tax, rather than corporation tax. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1000" SerialNumber="113">Clause 1000: Deduction for costs of setting up employee share ownership trust 
2576. This clause gives relief for the costs of setting up a qualifying employee share 
ownership trust (QUEST). It is based on sections 21A, 75 and 85A of ICTA. 
 
2577. In practice it is unlikely that a QUEST would be set up in an accounting period 
to which this Bill applies. Section 67 of FA 1989 gave relief for employers&#8217; 
contributions to QUESTs. That relief was withdrawn by section 142 of FA 2003 with 
effect for contributions made in accounting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2003. Relief for the provision of shares through a QUEST is given now by 
Schedule 23 to FA 2003, rewritten in Part 12 of this Bill. 
 
2578. The relief given by section 85A of ICTA for the setting up costs was not 
withdrawn and is still available in the event that a company did set up a new QUEST. 
The clause is very similar to clause 999. 
 
2579. This Bill does not rewrite section 85 of ICTA (payments to trustees of 
approved profit sharing schemes). Approved profit sharing schemes were phased out 
by section 49 of FA 2000, and the deduction in section 85 of ICTA was phased out by 
section 50 of FA 2000. This Bill accordingly does not rewrite section 85 of ICTA (or 
section 50 of FA 2000). 
 
</Clause></Chapter></Part><Part Number="12" SerialNumber="114">Part 12: Other relief for employee share acquisitions 
Overview 
2580. This Part and Part 11 give specific statutory deductions for various costs 
associated with setting up and operating employee share schemes. These are 
arrangements under which employers provide incentives for their employees in the 
form of shares. This Part is based on Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2581. The relief given is available to companies carrying on all types of business. 
There are no requirements as to how the company funds or structures the 
arrangements. It applies to shares that are newly issued, acquired in the market or 
acquired by private purchase. It applies to formal plans operated through trusts and to 
informal arrangements. 
 
2582. Although the Part gives relief to a company, usually the employing company, 
in calculating its corporation tax profits the availability and the amount of the relief 
are closely related to the income tax position of the employee. Because of the links to 
employment income this Part makes frequent reference to provisions in ITEPA.

</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="2" SerialNumber="121">Chapter 2: Relief if shares acquired by employee or other person 
Overview 
2592. This Chapter gives relief for an acquisition of shares. It is based on Part 2 of 
Schedule 23 to FA 2003. The source legislation describes the process by which the 
shares are acquired as an award of the shares. For the purposes of Schedule 23 it 
means any acquisition of shares that does not require the exercise of a right to make 
the acquisition. Relief for shares acquired through the exercise of an option is given 
by Part 3 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003, rewritten as Chapter 3 of this Part. 
 
2593. This Chapter refers merely to shares being acquired by the employee or 
another person. The boundary between this Chapter and Chapter 3 is created by 
clause 1007(1)(e). This prevents relief being given under both Chapters and gives 
priority to Chapter 3. 
 
2594. This Chapter applies to the acquisition of all types of shares including 
restricted shares and convertible shares. This is a different structure from that in the 
source legislation. In the source legislation the application of Part 2 of Schedule 23 is 
modified to deal with restricted shares and convertible shares. In this Chapter, and 
Chapter 3, the conditions to qualify for relief and the amount of the relief are set out 
in full. Chapters 4 and 5 then give additional relief for future events that affect 
restricted shares and convertible shares after they have been acquired.

2595. This clause gives an overview of the Chapter. It is new. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1007" SerialNumber="123">Clause 1007: Basic requirements for relief under Chapter 2 
2596. This clause sets out the basic requirements for relief under this Chapter. It is 
based on paragraphs 1 and 3 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1008" SerialNumber="124">Clause 1008: Conditions relating to shares acquired 
2597. This clause identifies the type of shares that have to be acquired. It is based on 
paragraphs 4 and 6 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1009" SerialNumber="125">Clause 1009: Conditions relating to employee&#8217;s income tax position 
2598. This clause gives the conditions that must be met in relation to the employee&#8217;s 
income tax position. It is based on paragraphs 7 and 20 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2599. The &#8220;employee&#8221; is the person defined in clause 1007(1)(a) as the person in 
respect of whose employment the shares are acquired. 
 
2600. Subsection (1) deals with the acquisition of shares other than restricted shares. 
So it applies to the acquisition of convertible shares. The acquisition of the shares has 
to result in an income tax charge on the employee. 
 
2601. Relief is not given if section 446UA of ITEPA applies to the shares. That 
provision applies to shares acquired for less than their market value under 
arrangements that seek to avoid the income tax charge or the national insurance 
contribution on the employment income. 
 
2602. Subsection (2) applies if the shares are restricted shares. 
 
2603. Relief will be available in two circumstances. 
 
2604. First, if as a result of the acquisition there is an employment income tax charge 
on earnings as defined in Chapter 1 of Part 3 of ITEPA. This is a charge on the 
money&#8217;s worth of the shares. The test is met at the time of acquisition. 
 
2605. Second, if on acquisition there is no immediate employment income tax 
charge, but there will be such a charge if there occurs later a chargeable event in 
respect of the shares. The test is met at the time of acquisition. The company does not 
have to suspend its claim until that later event actually occurs. It is sufficient that on 
acquisition the circumstances are such that it appears that the employee will become 
subject to a charge under section 426 of ITEPA. One reason why there may be no 
immediate income tax charge is if the shares are forfeitable and the exemption in 
section 425(2) of ITEPA applies. 
 
2606. The events that trigger a later charge are listed in section 427(3) of ITEPA. 
They include, for example, a lifting of the restrictions at a time when the recipient of 
the shares or an associated person still owns the shares. (The definition of associated 
person for the purposes of section 427 of ITEPA is in section 421C(1) of ITEPA and 
includes the person who acquired the shares.) 
 
2607. This clause does not rewrite paragraph 20(3) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
Paragraph 20(3) provides that the test in paragraph 20(2)(a)(ii) of Schedule 23 to 
FA 2003 is applied on the assumption that section 426 of ITEPA continues to apply 
after the employee dies. Paragraph 20(2)(a)(ii) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003 is rewritten 
as subsection (2)(b). 
 
2608. Paragraph 20(3) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003 is not necessary where the 
employee dies after acquiring shares but before becoming subject to a charge. This is 
because the test in paragraph 20(2)(a)(ii) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003 is applied to the 
circumstances existing on acquisition. It does not apply on the subsequent chargeable 
event (for example, the lifting of the restriction). Since the test has already been met 
on acquisition, it is not necessary to rely on paragraph 20(3) to provide for the case in 
which section 426 of ITEPA ceases to apply because of some future event. The fact 
that the employee dies before the restriction is lifted and the section 426 charge does 
not materialise is irrelevant for the purposes of the test in paragraph 20(2)(a)(ii). 
 
2609. Paragraph 20(3) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003 cannot be relevant to a company&#8217;s 
entitlement to relief under this Part where the employee dies before acquiring shares. 
If while alive the employee possesses a right to acquire shares then the employee 
possesses an option and corporation tax relief will be available under Chapter 3 of this 
Part. If while alive the employee does not enjoy a right to acquire shares and no shares 
are acquired by a person before the employee&#8217;s death, but after the employee&#8217;s death 
shares are acquired by a person, then for both practical and technical reasons 
corporation tax relief under this Part is not available. See also the commentary on 
clause 1025. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1010" SerialNumber="126">Clause 1010: Calculation of relief if shares are neither restricted nor convertible 
2610. This clause gives the amount of the relief if the shares are neither restricted 
nor convertible. It is based on paragraph 8 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1011" SerialNumber="127">Clause 1011: Calculation of relief if shares are restricted or convertible 
2611. This clause gives the amount of relief if the shares are restricted or 
convertible. It is based on paragraphs 21 and 22C of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2612. Subsections (2) and (3) give the basic rule that the relief is equal to the amount 
that counts as earnings of the employee from the employment in respect of which the 
shares were acquired. This is the money&#8217;s worth charge in Chapter 1 of Part 3 of 
ITEPA. It will be equal to the market value of the shares. 
 
2613. If the shares are restricted shares the valuation takes account of the restriction 
unless the employer and employee have made a joint election under section 431 of 
ITEPA that the shares are valued as if they were not restricted shares (section 431(1)), 
or as if particular restrictions did not apply (section 431(2)). Either election will give 
the employee a higher employment income charge on acquisition which is mirrored in 
greater relief being given to the employer. If an election under section 431(1) is made 
there will be no later employment income charge if the restrictions are lifted and no 
additional relief will be available to the employer under Chapter 4 of this Part. 
 
2614. If the shares are convertible shares the basis of valuation in section 437(1) of 
ITEPA applies. The shares are valued as if they are not convertible. Instead of 
referring the reader to section 437(1), and rewriting the disapplication of 
section 437(2) in paragraph 22C(4A) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003, the full out words in 
subsection (3) state the valuation rule in section 437(1). 
 
2615. There is a difference between subsections (2) and (3) which is not apparent 
from the text. This is that the calculation under subsection (2) is made by reference to 
Chapter 2 of Part 7 of ITEPA, while the calculation under subsection (3) is made by 
reference to Chapter 3 of that Part. In effect, different rules apply to the calculation 
under these two subsections. It is therefore possible that the calculations under these 
two subsections will yield different amounts. 
 
2616. Subsection (5) rewrites the comparison in paragraphs 21(5) and 22C(5) of 
Schedule 23 to FA 2003 if the shares are both restricted and convertible. The 
company may claim relief for the higher figure (as yielded by subsection (2) or (3)) 
even if the employee has or will be chargeable to tax on a different amount in respect 
of the shares acquired.

2617. This clause restricts the relief if the shares are given partly for employment in 
a qualifying business and partly for employment in a business that does not qualify. It

</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="3" SerialNumber="130">Chapter 3: Relief if employee or other person obtains option to acquire shares 
Overview 
2619. The Chapter gives relief for the acquisition of shares &#8220;pursuant to an option&#8221;. 
It is based on Part 3 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. &#8220;Option&#8221; is defined in clause 1005 to 
include &#8220;any right to acquire shares&#8221;. This definition is based on the definition of 
&#8220;securities option&#8221; in section 420(8) of ITEPA. Using a similar definition of &#8220;option&#8221; 
relates the relief given to the employing company to the income tax charge on the 
employee. 
 
2620. The definition is wider than the normal meaning of option as the shares may 
be acquired without the need to exercise any right. The Chapter follows the source 
legislation in describing this as the acquisition of shares &#8220;pursuant to an option&#8221;. This 
is also to align the language in this Chapter with that used in ITEPA. See, for 
example, section 477(3)(a) of ITEPA. 
 
2621. Like Chapter 2 this Chapter gives relief for the acquisition of all types of share 
including restricted shares and convertible shares. The Chapter has rules to deal with a 
change in circumstances between the grant of the option and the acquisition of the 
shares (for example, the death of the employee or original option holder or a take-over 
of the employing company). 
 
<Clause Number="1014" SerialNumber="131">Clause 1014: Overview of Chapter 
2622. This clause gives an overview of the Chapter. It is new. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1015" SerialNumber="132">Clause 1015: Basic requirements for relief under Chapter 3 
2623. This clause sets out the basic requirements for relief under this Chapter. It is 
based on paragraphs 1, 3 and 27 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2624. The requirements are very similar to those which apply to relief under 
Chapter 2. See clause 1007. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1016" SerialNumber="133">Clause 1016: Conditions relating to shares acquired 
2625. This clause identifies the type of shares that have to be acquired. It is based on 
paragraphs 4 and 12 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1017" SerialNumber="134">Clause 1017: Condition relating to employee&#8217;s income tax position 
2626. This clause gives the conditions that must be met in relation to the employee&#8217;s 
income tax position. It is based on paragraphs 14 and 27 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2627. Subsection (1) gives the basic rule that the acquisition must be a chargeable 
event for the purposes of section 476 of ITEPA. Section 476(2) of ITEPA provides 
that &#8220;chargeable event&#8221; has the meaning given by section 477 of ITEPA. The list of 
chargeable events is given in section 477(3) of ITEPA. 
 
2628. The only event relevant to this Chapter is section 477(3)(a) which applies to 
&#8220;the acquisition of securities pursuant to the employment-related securities option by 
an associated person&#8221;. (The definition of &#8220;associated person&#8221; for the purposes of 
section 477 of ITEPA, in section 472(1) of ITEPA, includes the person who acquired 
the option.) 
 
2629. The income tax condition is satisfied whether or not an amount counts as 
employment income as a result of the chargeable event. This covers the case in which 
the shares are acquired under an approved share option scheme under which there is 
no charge on the acquisition. For example, section 519 of ITEPA provides that no 
liability to income tax arises on the exercise of an option under an approved SAYE 
option scheme. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1018" SerialNumber="135">Clause 1018: Calculation of relief if shares are neither restricted nor convertible 
2630. This clause gives the amount of the relief if the shares are neither restricted 
nor convertible. It is based on paragraph 15 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1019" SerialNumber="136">Clause 1019: Calculation of relief if shares are restricted or convertible 
2631. This clause gives the amount of the relief if the shares are restricted or 
convertible, where they are acquired pursuant to an option. It is based on 
paragraphs 21 and 22C of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2632. Subsections (2)(a) and (3)(a) give the basic rule. The relief is equal to the 
amount that counts as employment income under section 476 of ITEPA when the 
shares are acquired. The chargeable amount is given in section 478 of ITEPA. In 
broad terms it is the market value of the shares at the time they are acquired 
(section 479 of ITEPA) less any consideration given for the shares and any expenses 
incurred on the acquisition (section 480 of ITEPA). 
 
2633. Subsections (2)(b) and (3)(b) modify the basic rule if the option is a qualifying 
option under the EMI (Enterprise Management Incentives) code. The effect of that 
code is ignored in calculating the amount of the relief. The EMI code is defined in 
section 527(3) of ITEPA. A qualifying option is defined in section 527(4) of ITEPA. 
 
2634. This modification is needed to deal with the interaction between sections 476 
and 531 of ITEPA. Section 531 of ITEPA sets out how to calculate the amount that 
counts as employment income under section 476 of ITEPA if the option allows the 
shares to be acquired at a discount to their market value at the date the option is 
granted. The amount that counts as employment income is that market value less any 
consideration given for the option and any consideration given for the shares. This 
limits the employment income charge on the employee to the amount of the discount. 
 
2635. Subsections (2)(b) and (3)(b) ensure that the company gets a deduction for the 
market value of the shares at the date they are acquired under the option less any 
consideration given for the shares and any expenses incurred on the acquisition. 
 
2636. The full out words at the end of subsection (3) are similar to the full out words 
at the end of clause 1011(3). If the shares are convertible shares they are valued on the 
basis that they are not convertible. This is the normal method of valuation that 
section 437(1) of ITEPA applies to such shares. 
 
2637. There is a difference between subsections (2) and (3) which is not apparent 
from the text. This is that the calculation under subsection (2) is made by reference to 
Chapter 2 of Part 7 of ITEPA, while the calculation under subsection (3) is made by 
reference to Chapter 3 of that Part. In effect, different rules apply to the calculation 
under these two subsections. It is therefore possible that the calculations under these 
two subsections will yield different amounts. 
 
2638. Subsection (4)(a) states the rule that, in calculating the amount of relief given 
to the company, no deduction is made for the relief given to the employee by 
sections 481 and 482 of ITEPA. These sections reduce the employment income 
charge by the amount of certain national insurance contributions paid by the 
employee. 
 
2639. Subsection (5) rewrites the comparison in paragraphs 21(5) and 22C(5) of 
Schedule 23 to FA 2003 if the shares are both restricted and convertible. The 
company may claim relief for the higher figure (as yielded by subsection (2) or (3)) 
even if the employee has or will be chargeable to tax on a different amount in respect 
of the shares acquired. 
 
2640. Subsection (6) deals with the case in which the employee dies before the 
shares are acquired so there is no employment income charge on which to calculate 
the relief. It is based on paragraph 27(1) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2641. Strictly speaking paragraph 27(1) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003 deems the 
employee to be alive only for the purposes of the income tax condition in 
paragraph 14 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. Subsection (6) extends that treatment to the 
calculation of the relief.

2650. Paragraph 23(1)(a) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003 applies the rule rewritten in this 
clause to an award of shares. The rule for relief given by Chapter 2 of this Part is not 
rewritten here as that Chapter gives no scope for a transfer of the business before the 
shares are acquired. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="4" SerialNumber="142">Chapter 4: Additional relief in cases involving restricted shares 
Overview 
2651. This Chapter applies if the shares acquired, either directly or pursuant to an 
option, are restricted shares. It gives the company further relief if an employment 
income charge arises after the shares have been acquired or if the employee dies. It is 
based on Part 4 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2652. Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings) provides that the special rules for 
restricted shares in this Part do not apply to shares acquired before 16 April 2003. If 
shares acquired before that date are forfeitable shares as defined in paragraph 19 of 
Schedule 23 to FA 2003 (as originally enacted) that Schedule continues to apply. 

 
<Clause Number="1025" SerialNumber="143">Clause 1025: Additional relief available if shares acquired are restricted shares 
2653. This clause sets out the basic conditions for the relief to apply and identifies 
the company to which the relief is given. It is based on paragraph 21 of Schedule 23 
to FA 2003. 
 
2654. Subsection (1) gives the two basic conditions for the relief to apply. 
 
2655. First, subsection (1)(a), the company must have been entitled to relief under 
either Chapter 2 or Chapter 3 in relation to restricted shares which have been acquired 
either directly or through an option. This condition will still be met if the amount of 
the relief is nil possibly because section 425(1) of ITEPA has applied to an acquisition 
of forfeitable shares. See the commentary on clause 1009(2). 
 
2656. For a number of years after this Bill takes effect initial relief on the acquisition 
of the shares will have been given not under Chapters 2 and 3 of this Part but under 
Schedule 23 to FA 2003. In that case the continuity of law provisions in Schedule 2 
(transitionals and savings), apply to treat references to Chapters 2 and 3 as if they 
were references to the equivalent provisions in the source legislation. Schedule 2 
gives a signpost to those provisions and states their effect. 
 
2657. Second, subsection (1)(b), after the shares have been acquired either 
section 426 of ITEPA applies (so giving the employee an amount of employment 
income) or the employee dies. 
 
2658. The chargeable events that can give rise to a post-acquisition employment 
income charge under section 426 of ITEPA are listed in section 427(3) of ITEPA. 
 
2659. The definition of &#8220;associated person&#8221; in section 421C(1) of ITEPA includes 
the person who acquired the shares. 
 
2660. There will be no employment income charge if the employee dies before any 
of the events listed in section 427(3) of ITEPA occurs. Section 421B(4) and (6) of 
ITEPA provides that Chapter 2 of Part 7 of ITEPA ceases to apply to the securities 
immediately before the death of the employee. 
 
2661. Subsection (1) treats the death as a chargeable event and gives the relief that 
would have been given if there had been an actual chargeable event at the date of 
death. No further relief is available under subsection (1) as the death of the employee 
prevents any further charge arising under section 426 of ITEPA. 
 
2662. This clause does not give relief if the employee has died before the shares are 
acquired. First, the deeming provision in paragraph 20(3) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003 
(see the commentary on clause 1009) is not expressed to apply to paragraph 21 of 
Schedule 23. Second, paragraph 21(2)(c) of Schedule 23, when read with 
paragraph 21(7) of Schedule 23, can work sensibly only if the employee dies after the 
shares are acquired. Third, the inclusion of paragraph 21(2)(c) of Schedule 23 itself 
indicates that paragraph 21(2)(b) of Schedule 23 applies only while the employee is 
alive.

in section 427(3) of ITEPA. It is based on paragraphs 21 and 22 of Schedule 23 to 
FA 2003. 
 
2664. Various reliefs are available in calculating the amount that counts as 
employment income but these reliefs are not deducted from the relief given to the 
company (see subsection (4)).

2666. The amount of the relief is calculated by deeming the shares to be sold to an 
unconnected person immediately before the death of the employee (see 
subsection (3)). This deemed sale is a chargeable event within section 427(3) of

2667. This clause explains how relief is given under the Chapter. It is based on 
paragraphs 9, 16 and 21 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2668. The clause does not repeat the rules but cross-refers to the equivalent 
provisions in Chapters 2 and 3. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1029" SerialNumber="147">Clause 1029: Transfer of qualifying business by group transfers 
2669. This clause gives relief to the successor company if the business carried on by 
the employing company is transferred before a chargeable event or the death of the 
employee. It is based on paragraph 23 of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2670. The clause is very similar to clause 1024 which gives relief to a successor 
company if the business is transferred some time between the grant of the option and 
the acquisition of shares pursuant to the option. Clause 1024 identifies this time-frame 
as the &#8220;option period&#8221;. 
 
2671. Subsection (6) provides that the &#8220;interim period&#8221; for this clause starts when the 
shares or option are acquired. If the original relief has been given under Chapter 3 this 
means the &#8220;interim period&#8221; will include the period before the shares are acquired. This 
rule is needed to give relief to the successor company if there is a group transfer 
before the shares are acquired. 
2672. Clause 1024 will give relief under Chapter 3 and clause 1029 will give relief 
under this Chapter. Clause 1029 would apply also if there was a further transfer after 
the shares had been acquired but before a chargeable event or the death of the 
employee. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="5" SerialNumber="148">Chapter 5: Additional relief in cases involving convertible securities 
Overview 
2673. This Chapter provides relief if the shares acquired, either directly or pursuant 
to an option, are convertible shares. It gives additional relief if a further employment 
income charge arises or the employee dies after the shares have been acquired and it 
also applies if there is an acquisition of convertible securities which are converted into 
qualifying shares. It is based on Part 4A of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
<Clause Number="1030" SerialNumber="149">Clause 1030: Application of Chapter 
2674. This clause gives the conditions for the Chapter to apply. It is based on 
paragraphs 22B and 22C of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2675. As with relief under Chapter 4 the continuity of law provisions will apply if 
the shares or securities were acquired when Schedule 23 to FA 2003 was still in force. 
See the commentary on clause 1025. 
 
2676. Subsection (5) applies if the original recipient of an option dies and as a result 
the shares or securities are acquired by a different person. Relief under Chapter 3 on 
the acquisition of the shares is given by clause 1015(3) which treats the shares as 
acquired by the original recipient of the option. Subsection (5) does the same for relief 
under this Chapter. 
 
2677. Subsection (6) applies if there has been a takeover of the company whose 
shares were to be acquired and the options have been exchanged for options in a new 
company. Clause 1022 gives relief under Chapter 3. Subsection (6) does the same for 
relief under this Chapter. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1031" SerialNumber="150">Clause 1031: Additional relief available if shares acquired are convertible shares 
etc 
2678. This clause governs the events upon which and the timing on which relief is 
available. It is based on paragraphs 22C and 22D of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2679. Subsection (2) applies if the employee has died and there is a chargeable event 
that would have given rise to an employment income charge if the employee had been 
alive. Paragraph 22C(2)(c) of Schedule 23 to FA 2003 refers to relief being available 
on the death of the employee. In fact the availability of the relief is not triggered by 
the death of the employee but by the occurrence of a later chargeable event after the 
death. This sequence is reflected in subsection (3). 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1032" SerialNumber="151">Clause 1032: Meaning of &#8220;chargeable event&#8221;

</Clause><Clause Number="1034" SerialNumber="153">Clause 1034: Relief available following death of employee 
2682. This clause identifies the amount of the relief available if the employee dies. It 
is based on paragraphs 22C and 22D of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2683. Subsections (3) and (4) provide relief which is similar to that given by 
clause 1027 for restricted shares in that it is the amount that would count as 
employment income if the employee were still alive. But, under subsection (2), unlike 
clause 1027, relief is given for the accounting period in which the event occurs, not 
the period in which the employee dies. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1035" SerialNumber="154">Clause 1035: Supplementary provision for purposes of sections 1033 and 1034

paragraphs 9, 16 and 22C of Schedule 23 to FA 2003. 
 
2685. The clause does not repeat the rules but cross-refers to the equivalent 
provisions in Chapters 2 and 3. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1036" SerialNumber="155">Clause 1036: Transfer of qualifying business by group transfers

performs for restricted shares.

</Clause></Chapter></Part><Part Number="13" SerialNumber="158">Part 13: Additional relief for expenditure on research and development 
Overview 
2691. This Part gives additional relief for expenditure by a company on research and 
development including research and development into certain vaccines. It is based on 
Schedule 20 to FA 2000 and Schedules 12 and 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2692. The relief is given in addition to any deduction allowed in calculating the 
company&#8217;s trade profits. For example, clause 87 in Part 3 (trading income) provides a 
deduction for expenditure on research and development. 
 
2693. References to research and development are abbreviated to R&#38;D when used in 
a longer phrase or a long clause title. See, for example, &#8220;R&#38;D threshold&#8221; in 
clause 1050. 
 
2694. In this Part, the rates at which the various reliefs are stated to be available 
apply only if the expenditure was incurred on or after 1 August 2008. Schedule 2 
(transitionals and savings) preserves this commencement rule by providing that, in 
relation to expenditure incurred before that date, the reliefs are available at the rates 
previously applicable. 
 
<Chapter Number="1" SerialNumber="159">Chapter 1: Introduction 
<Clause Number="1039" SerialNumber="160">Clause 1039: Overview of Part 
2695. This clause gives an overview of the Part. It is new. 
 
2696. The source legislation refers to &#8220;tax relief&#8221; given to companies in calculating 
their trade profits. Subsection (1) makes clear that the relief is given only to 
companies liable to corporation tax. See Change 77 in Annex 1. This change affects 
the following clauses in this Part: clauses 1044, 1045, 1063, 1068, 1074, 1087 
and 1092. 
 
2697. The reference to Part 9A of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 in subsection (10) is to 
that Part as amended by this Bill (see Schedule 1). As this Bill brings all the additional 
reliefs for research and development together, it repeals Parts 9BA and 9C of 
Schedule 18 to FA 1998. 
 
2698. Chapters 2 to 4 and 7 of this Part provide for relief in the case of companies 
which are small or medium-sized enterprises as defined for the purposes of European 
Union rules on state aid. Clause 1120 modifies the basic definition of &#8220;small or 
medium-sized enterprise&#8221; in clause 1119 by increasing the limits above which a 
company ceases to be a small or medium-sized enterprise. Schedule 2 (transitionals 
and savings) contains provision excluding that modified definition in relation to 
expenditure incurred before 1 August 2008. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1040" SerialNumber="161">Clause 1040: Relief may be available under more than one Chapter of Part 
2699. This clause confirms that &#8220;double relief&#8221; may be available in certain 
circumstances. It is based on paragraphs 7 and 10A of Schedule 12 to FA 2002 and 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1041" SerialNumber="162">Clause 1041: &#8220;Research and development&#8221; 
2700. This clause applies the definition of &#8220;research and development&#8221; in 
section 837A of ICTA to this Part. It is based on paragraph 25 of Schedule 20 to 
FA 2000, paragraph 19 of Schedule 12 and paragraph 27 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2701. This phrase is used because it has a specific meaning in guidelines published 
by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (formerly, the 
Department of Trade and Industry). Details can be found on the website 
www.businesslink.gov.uk. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1042" SerialNumber="163">Clause 1042: &#8220;Relevant research and development&#8221; 
2702. This clause defines &#8220;relevant research and development&#8221;. It is based on 
paragraph 4 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000, paragraph 17 of Schedule 12 and paragraph 5 
of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2703. &#8220;Relevant research and development&#8221; is a key concept. All of the reliefs given 
in this Part include a condition that the expenditure is incurred on relevant research 
and development in relation to the company. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="2" SerialNumber="164">Chapter 2: Relief for SMEs: cost of R&#38;D incurred by SME 
Overview 
2704. This Chapter sets out some rules that apply to a &#8220;small or medium sized 
enterprise&#8221; (&#8220;SME&#8221;). An SME is defined in clause 1119. 
 
<Clause Number="1043" SerialNumber="165">Clause 1043: Overview of Chapter 
2705. This clause summarises the contents of this Chapter. It is new. 
 
2706. This Chapter rewrites the reliefs given by Schedule 20 to FA 2000 if a small or 
medium-sized enterprise incurs expenditure on in-house direct research and 
development or research and development that is sub-contracted out by it. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1044" SerialNumber="166">Clause 1044: Additional deduction in calculating profits of trade 
2707. This clause allows the company to claim the relief, gives the conditions that 
have to be met and the amount of the relief. It is based on paragraphs 1 and 13 of 
Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
2708. Relief under this Chapter is given as an additional deduction for expenditure 
that is already deductible in calculating trade profits (see subsections (5) and (7)). The 
amount of the deduction is increased by 75% (see subsection (8)). 
2709. The relief has to be claimed (see subsection (6)). The procedure for making 
the claim is in Part 9A of Schedule 18 to FA 1998. 
 
2710. This clause makes clear that relief is given only to companies liable to 
corporation tax. See Change 77 in Annex 1 and the commentary on clause 1039 
(overview of Part). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1045" SerialNumber="167">Clause 1045: Alternative treatment for pre-trading expenditure: deemed trading 
loss 
2711. This clause allows a small or medium-sized enterprise to claim immediate 
relief for qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in a pre-trading 
period. It is based on paragraphs 1 and 14 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
2712. The usual treatment of expenditure incurred before a company starts trading is 
given by clause 61 in Part 3 (trading income). Expenditure incurred up to seven years 
before the day the company starts to trade is treated as incurred on that day if it would 
have been deductible had the company been trading when the expenditure was 
incurred. 
 
2713. This clause allows the company to elect for pre-trading expenditure to create a 
deemed trade loss for the accounting period in which it was actually incurred. Subject 
to the restrictions in clauses 1048 and 1049 the loss can be used in the same way as 
other trade losses. It can be set off against other profits under section 393A of ICTA 
or surrendered as group relief. Any part of the loss not used is carried forward. See the 
commentary on clause 1048. 
 
2714. If the company is entitled to relief because it has made an election under this 
clause, subsection (8) provides that the expenditure is not allowed again under the 
ordinary rules in clause 61 for dealing with pre-trading expenditure. 
 
2715. The company has to meet the other qualifying conditions for the relief. In 
particular the pre-trading expenditure must exceed the threshold for relief (see 
subsection (3)) See the commentary on clause 1050(5)(b) for more details on the 
treatment of pre-trading expenditure for the purposes of the threshold test. 
 
2716. This clause makes clear that relief is given only to companies liable to 
corporation tax. See Change 77 in Annex 1 and the commentary on clause 1039 
(overview of Part). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1046" SerialNumber="168">Clause 1046: Relief only available where company is going concern 
2717. This clause sets out a precondition for relief under clauses 1044 and 1045. It is 
based on paragraph 18A of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1047" SerialNumber="169">Clause 1047: Elections under section 1045 
2718. This clause sets out the procedure for making an election under clause 1045. It 
is based on paragraph 14 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1048" SerialNumber="170">Clause 1048: Treatment of deemed trading loss under section 1045 
2719. This clause imposes a restriction on the use of a deemed trade loss and 
explains how any unused loss is to be dealt with. It is based on paragraph 23 of 
Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
2720. It is not a condition of clause 1045 that the pre-trading research and 
development leads to the establishment of a trade. But if it does any of the loss created 
by the clause 1045 election that is unused when the trade starts is treated as a trade 
loss brought forward (see subsections (3) and (4)). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1049" SerialNumber="171">Clause 1049: Restriction on consortium relief 
2721. This clause prevents a loss created by relief given under this Chapter being 
surrendered as consortium relief unless the claimant company is also a small or 
medium-sized enterprise. It is based on paragraph 22 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1050" SerialNumber="172">Clause 1050: R&#38;D threshold 
2722. This clause gives the minimum amount of qualifying expenditure the company 
must incur in an accounting period to claim relief under this Chapter. It is based on 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
2723. Subsection (2) reduces this limit proportionately if the accounting period is 
less than 12 months. The source legislation does not explicitly state how the reduction 
is done. Subsection (2) eliminates uncertainty by prescribing the arithmetic formula to 
be used where an accounting period is less than 12 months. The formula adopted has 
been widely used in the rewrite Acts. It incorporates a denominator of 365 days, 
regardless of the length of the calendar year. In this case, it makes a small change 
adverse to the taxpayer. See Change 78 in Annex 1. This Change also affects 
clauses 1064, 1075, 1097 (see paragraphs 2766, 2803 and 2848). 
 
2724. Subsection (5)(b) deals with pre-trading expenditure by deeming the company 
to be carrying on a trade for the purpose of deciding whether the expenditure would 
be deductible. In the absence of any special tax rule to the contrary pre-trading 
expenditure is allocated to periods of account in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting practice. 
 
2725. Subsection (5)(b) is needed for the purposes of clause 1045. That clause 
allows a company to elect to create a trade loss out of its pre-trading expenditure on 
qualifying research and development. Clause 1045(3) requires the company to meet 
the threshold test in the period covered by the election. 
 
2726. Clause 1137 may also be relevant in this regard. It applies to a company that 
incurs qualifying Chapter 2 or 7 expenditure at a time when it does not have an 
accounting period. In practice this must be pre-trading expenditure. The clause deems 
the company to have the accounting periods it would have had if it had been trading 
when it incurred the expenditure. 
2727. Subsections (7) and (8) deal with expenditure that qualifies under Chapters 3 
and 4 of this Part. The basic rule applies. The expenditure must be deductible in 
calculating the trade profits for the accounting period. In this case the ordinary 
operation of clause 61 is not suspended. 
 
2728. There is no requirement in this clause that the expenditure is incurred in the 
same trade or pre-trading activity. So qualifying expenditure on one trade can be used 
to meet the threshold required to make a claim under clause 1045 in respect of pre- 
trading expenditure on a separate activity. 
 
2729. There have been a number of changes to the threshold since the relief was 
introduced by Schedule 20 to FA 2000. Most of these are not relevant to the 
accounting periods affected by this Bill. But Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings), 
provides that expenditure incurred before 1 April 2002 is ignored for the purposes of 
subsection (3)(b) and (c), and that clause 61 (which provides for up to 7 years&#8217; worth 
of pre-trading expenses to be treated as incurred on the start date of the trade) is 
ignored in applying this rule. 
 
2730. In relation to qualifying Chapter 3 expenditure the transitional rule preserves 
the effect of paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 15 to FA 2002. That provision extended the 
threshold test to include expenditure that qualifies under Part 2 of Schedule 12 to 
FA 2002, rewritten in Chapter 3 of this Part. 
 
2731. Paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 15 to FA 2002 provides that the extension does not 
apply to expenditure incurred before 1 April 2002 and that for this purpose no account 
is taken of section 401 of ICTA. 
 
2732. In relation to qualifying Chapter 4 expenditure the transitional preserves the 
effect of paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 31 to FA 2003. That provision extended the 
threshold test to include qualifying additional SME expenditure as defined in 
paragraph 10B of Schedule 12 to FA 2002, rewritten in this Part in Chapter 4. 
 
2733. Paragraph 10B(a) of Schedule 12 to FA 2002 provides that: 
 
    &#8220;qualifying additional expenditure&#8221; is any expenditure which had the SME been a large company 
    throughout the accounting period in question, would have been qualifying R&#38;D expenditure of that 
    company 
 
2734. This brings into play the commencement provision in paragraph 20(1) of 
Schedule 12 to FA 2002, which provides that Schedule 12 does not apply to 
expenditure incurred before 1 April 2002 and that &#8220;for this purpose no account shall 
be taken of section 401 of ICTA&#8221;. 
 
2735. There are very limited circumstances in which the transitional will apply. This 
Bill will have effect for accounting periods ending after 31 March 2009. The earliest 
date on which an accounting period covered by the Bill could start is 2 April 2008. 
For the transitional rule to apply the expenditure would have to be incurred in the 
period between 2 April 2001 and 31 March 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1051" SerialNumber="173">Clause 1051: Qualifying Chapter 2 expenditure 
2736. This clause identifies the expenditure that qualifies for relief under this 
Chapter. It is new. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1052" SerialNumber="174">Clause 1052: Qualifying expenditure on in-house direct R&#38;D 
2737. The clause defines &#8220;qualifying expenditure on in-house direct research and 
development&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
2738. The broad aim of Schedule 20 to FA 2000 is to give relief to the company that 
incurs the expenditure on the research and development. Paragraph 3(3) of 
Schedule 20 to FA 2000 describes that as research and development directly 
undertaken &#8220;by the company&#8221; or &#8220;on its behalf&#8221;. A common set of conditions is used 
to decide whether expenditure on either type of research and development qualifies 
for relief. 
 
2739. This Bill uses the labels &#8220;in-house direct research and development&#8221; and 
&#8220;contracted out research and development&#8221; to describe the two types of research and 
development. It also rewrites the conditions that apply to each type of research and 
development separately. In part this is because the two types of activity are quite 
distinct and in part because the rules on sub-contractor payments apply only to 
contracted out research and development. 
 
2740. The term &#8220;in-house direct research and development&#8221; is merely a label. It is 
not a condition of the relief that the research and development is incurred &#8220;in-house&#8221;. 
The condition that the research and development is directly undertaken by the 
company is rewritten in subsection (3). This requires that the research and 
development is undertaken &#8220;by the company itself&#8221;. 
 
2741. The expression &#8220;in-house direct research and development&#8221; is used because it 
has a specific meaning in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory 
Reform guidelines on the meaning of research and development for tax purposes. See 
paragraph 2701. But the definition of what constitutes &#8220;direct research and 
development&#8221; in paragraph 3 of Schedule 12 and paragraph 3 of Schedule 13 to 
FA 2002 is identical in all material aspects to that in paragraph 3 of Schedule 20 to 
FA 2000. So referring to &#8220;in-house direct research and development&#8221; in this clause 
does not introduce a new condition into the rewrite of paragraph 3 of Schedule 20. 
 
2742. The clause does not reproduce the condition in paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 20 
to FA 2000 that the expenditure is not of a capital nature. This condition is 
unnecessary because clause 53 in Part 3 (trading income) already prohibits a 
deduction for capital expenditure.

2744. The clause does not reproduce the condition in paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 20 
to FA 2000 that the expenditure is not of a capital nature. This condition is

2746. Clauses 1054 to 1062 rewrite the paragraphs of Schedule 20 to FA 2000 that 
allow a small or medium-sized enterprise to surrender a loss, created as a result of the 
relief, in return for a cash payment described as an &#8220;R&#38;D tax credit&#8221;. 
 
2747. The clause clarifies that a company may make part claims (subsection (2)). 
 
2748. This Bill does not rewrite paragraph 24 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. This 
provision is no longer required, since the rule allowing the Commissioners for HMRC 
to deduct money for tax credits before paying their receipts into the Consolidated 
Fund is set out in sufficiently general terms in section 44 of CRCA (see 
subsections (1) and (3)(d) of that section). It is worth noting that paragraph 25 of 
Schedule 13 to FA 2002, which made similar provision to that made by paragraph 24 
of Schedule 20 to FA 2000, was repealed by paragraph 96 of Schedule 4 to CRCA.

Overview 
2760. This Chapter allows a company which is a small or medium-sized enterprise to 
claim relief for research and development sub-contracted to it. It is based on Part 2 of 
Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2761. The Chapter applies only to expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2002. See 
paragraph 20(1) of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings) 
preserves this commencement rule (which, for the purposes of this Bill, is relevant 
only to pre-trading expenditure). 
 
<Clause Number="1063" SerialNumber="186">Clause 1063: Additional deduction in calculating profits of trade 
2762. This clause allows a small or medium-sized enterprise to claim relief for 
expenditure on research and development contracted out to it. It is based on 
paragraph 11 of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
2763. As with relief under Chapter 2, relief under this Chapter is given as an 
additional deduction for expenditure that is already deductible in calculating trade 
profits (see subsections (4) and (6)). The amount of the deduction is increased by 30% 
(see subsection (7)). 
 
2764. This clause makes clear that relief is given only to companies liable to 
corporation tax. See Change 77 in Annex 1 and the commentary on clause 1039 
(overview of Part). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1064" SerialNumber="187">Clause 1064: R&#38;D threshold 
2765. This clause gives the minimum amount of qualifying expenditure the company 
must incur in an accounting period to claim relief under this Chapter. It is based on 
paragraph 7 of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2766. The rules are very similar to those in clause 1050. The minimum amount of 
expenditure is &#163;10,000, reduced proportionately if the accounting period is less 
than 12 months long. As in clause 1050, the source legislation does not explicitly state 
how the reduction is done. Subsection (2) removes any uncertainty by prescribing the 
arithmetic formula to be used. See Change 78 in Annex 1. 
 
2767. A significant difference to clause 1050 is the treatment of pre-trading 
expenditure. 
 
2768. Under subsection (5), unlike clause 1050, the normal rules in clause 61 for 
dealing with pre-trading expenditure are not suspended. Pre-trading expenditure is 
bunched into the accounting period in which the trade starts and counts towards the 
threshold for that period. This includes expenditure that qualifies under Chapter 2 of 
this Part. For the purposes of claiming relief under Chapter 2 itself clause 61 is 
suspended (see clause 1050(6)). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1065" SerialNumber="188">Clause 1065: Qualifying Chapter 3 expenditure 
2769. This clause identifies the expenditure that qualifies for relief under this 
Chapter. It is based on paragraph 8 of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2770. Relief is given to companies that undertake the research and development 
themselves (clause 1066), and to companies that commission the research and 
development from certain other persons (clause 1067). This clause prevents more than 
one company claiming the relief and the relief leaking out into the income tax sector. 
 
2771. If a large company commissions the research and development that company 
will not be able to claim relief under Chapter 5 of this Part. This is because that 
Chapter requires the company to carry out the research and development itself. If the 
research and development is contracted out to a small or medium-sized enterprise the 
effect of subsection (2) is to allow that small or medium-sized enterprise company to 
claim relief under this Chapter. 
2772. If the research and development is contracted out by another small or medium- 
sized enterprise that company will be able to claim relief itself under Chapter 2. 
Subsection (2) prevents relief being given to the sub-contractor company under this 
Chapter. 
 
2773. The relief given by this Part is restricted to corporation tax payers. 
Subsection (2) prevents a sub-contractor company getting relief if the work has been 
contracted out by a person, other than a large company, who could get a deduction for 
the payment in calculating its trade profits. This prevents the sub-contractor passing 
on some of the benefit of the relief to an income tax payer by charging lower prices. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1066" SerialNumber="189">Clause 1066: Expenditure on sub-contracted R&#38;D undertaken in-house 
2774. This clause identifies the expenditure which qualifies for relief if the company 
undertakes the research and development itself. It is based on paragraph 9 of 
Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2775. As in clause 1052, this clause uses the label &#8220;in-house&#8221; to describe research 
and development that the source legislation describes as being &#8220;directly undertaken&#8221; 
by the company. 
 
2776. The clause does not reproduce the condition in paragraph 9(4) of Schedule 12 
to FA 2002 that the expenditure is not of a capital nature. This condition is 
unnecessary because clause 53 in Part 3 (trading income) already prohibits a 
deduction for capital expenditure.

paragraph 10 to Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2778. The clause does not reproduce the condition in paragraph 10(4) of Schedule 12

Overview 
2779. This Chapter allows small or medium-sized enterprises to claim relief for 
expenditure on research and development that is subsidised on the same basis as 
provided for large companies (see Chapter 5 of this Part). It is based on Part 2A of 
Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2780. The Chapter applies only to expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2002. See 
paragraph 20(1) of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings) 
preserves this commencement rule (which, for the purposes of this Bill, is relevant

paragraph 11 of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2782. As with relief under Chapters 2 and 3, relief under Chapter 4 is given as an 
additional deduction for expenditure that is already deductible in calculating trade 
profits (see subsections (4) and (7)). The amount of the deduction is increased by 30% 
(see subsection (8)). 
 
2783. This clause makes clear that relief is given only to companies liable to

</Clause><Clause Number="1070" SerialNumber="194">Clause 1070: Qualifying Chapter 4 expenditure 
2785. This clause identifies the two categories of expenditure that qualify for relief 
under this Chapter. It is based on paragraph 10B of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2786. This Bill takes a different approach to identifying the qualifying conditions 
from that taken in the source legislation. Paragraph 10B of Schedule 12 to FA 2002 
defines what it calls &#8220;qualifying additional SME expenditure&#8221; by providing first that 
the expenditure would qualify for relief under Part 1 of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. It 
then superimposes the qualifying conditions in Schedule 20 to FA 2000. But it 
removes the condition that the expenditure must not be subsidised. 
 
2787. In this Chapter the qualifying conditions are set out in full to avoid the reader 
having to make these modifications. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1071" SerialNumber="195">Clause 1071: Subsidised qualifying expenditure on in-house direct R&#38;D 
2788. This clause defines what is meant by &#8220;subsidised qualifying expenditure on in- 
house direct research and development&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 10B of Schedule 12 
to FA 2002. 
 
2789. The clause does not rewrite the condition in paragraph 10B(c) of Schedule 12 
to FA 2002 that the expenditure &#8220;is not qualifying sub-contracted R&#38;D expenditure 
for the purposes of this Schedule&#8221;. It is unnecessary. 
 
2790. To qualify under Part 2A of Schedule 12 to FA 2002 the expenditure must 
qualify for relief under Schedule 20 to FA 2000 but for the fact it is subsidised. 
Expenditure would not qualify under Schedule 20 to FA 2000 if it were paid in 
respect of activities sub-contracted to the company. Condition E in subsection (6), 
which reproduces condition D in clause 1052, is all that is required. 
 
2791. This clause does not reproduce the condition that the expenditure must not be 
capital in nature. This condition is unnecessary because clause 53 in Part 3, the 
trading income Part, already prohibits a deduction for capital expenditure.

contracted out research and development&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 10B of 
Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2793. The clause does not allow a small or medium-sized enterprise to claim relief 
for a subsidised contribution to independent research and development. A large 
company can claim relief for such expenditure (see clause 1079). But a small or 
medium-sized enterprise cannot and therefore the condition in paragraph 10B(b) of 
Schedule 12 to FA 2002 would not be satisfied. 
 
2794. This clause does not reproduce the condition that the expenditure must not be 
capital in nature. This condition is unnecessary because clause 53 in Part 3 (trading

</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="5" SerialNumber="198">Chapter 5: Relief for large companies 
Overview 
2796. This Chapter gives relief for expenditure on direct research and development 
undertaken by a large company itself and for research and development that is 
contracted out to it. It is based on Part 1 of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2797. The Chapter applies only to expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2002. See 
paragraph 20(1) of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings) 
preserves this commencement rule (which, for the purposes of this Bill, is relevant 
only to pre-trading expenditure). 
 
2798. A &#8220;large company&#8221; is any company which is not a small or medium-sized 
enterprise (see clause 1122). 
 
<Clause Number="1074" SerialNumber="199">Clause 1074: Additional deduction in calculating profits of trade 
2799. This clause allows a large company to claim an additional deduction for 
qualifying expenditure on research and development. It is based on paragraph 11 of 
Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
2800. As with the reliefs given to small or medium-sized enterprises, relief under 
Chapter 5 is given as an additional deduction for expenditure that is already 
deductible in calculating trade profits (see subsection (6)). The amount of the 
deduction is increased by 30% (see subsection (7)). 
 
2801. This clause makes clear that relief is given only to companies liable to 
corporation tax. See Change 77 in Annex 1 and the commentary on clause 1039 
(overview of Part). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1075" SerialNumber="200">Clause 1075: R&#38;D threshold 
2802. This clause gives the minimum amount of expenditure that a company must 
incur in an accounting period to claim relief under this Chapter. It is based on 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2803. The minimum amount of expenditure is &#163;10,000, reduced proportionately if 
the accounting period is less than 12 months long. As in clause 1050, the source 
legislation does not explicitly state how the reduction is done. Subsection (2) removes 
any uncertainty by prescribing the arithmetic formula to be used. See Change 78 in 
Annex 1. 
 
2804. The normal operation of clause 61 is not suspended. So pre-trading 
expenditure that is bunched into the accounting period in which the trade starts counts 
towards the threshold (see subsection (4)). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1076" SerialNumber="201">Clause 1076: Qualifying Chapter 5 expenditure 
2805. This clause identifies the three categories of expenditure that qualify for relief 
under this Chapter. It is based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1077" SerialNumber="202">Clause 1077: Qualifying expenditure on in-house direct R&#38;D 
2806. This clause defines &#8220;qualifying expenditure on in-house direct research and 
development&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 4 of Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
2807. &#8220;In-house direct research and development&#8221; is the term this Bill uses to 
describe research and development that is undertaken directly by the company. 
 
2808. The clause does not reproduce the condition in paragraph 4(5) of Schedule 12 
to FA 2002 that the expenditure is not of a capital nature. This is not necessary as 
clause 53 in Part 3 (trading income) already prohibits a deduction for capital 
expenditure. 
 
2809. Condition C in subsection (4) identifies the expenditure that qualifies if the 
research and development is contracted out to the company. It prevents more than one 
company claiming the relief and the benefit of the relief leaking into the income tax 
sector. 
2810. If a large company commissions the research and development the company 
will not be able to claim relief under this Chapter. This is because that Chapter 
requires the company to carry out the research and development itself. So 
subsection (4) allows a large company to which the research and development is sub- 
contracted to claim the relief. 
 
2811. If the research and development is contracted out by a small or medium-sized 
enterprise that company will be able to claim relief itself under Chapter 2 of this Part. 
The effect of subsection (4) is to prevent relief also being given to the sub-contractor 
large company. 
 
2812. The relief given by this Part is restricted to corporation tax payers. 
Subsection (4) prevents a sub-contractor company getting relief if the work has been 
contracted out by a person, other than a large company, who could get a deduction for 
the payment in calculating its trade profits. This prevents the sub-contractor passing 
on some of the benefit of the relief to an income tax payer by charging lower prices.

available for vaccine research. It is based on paragraph 4 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2827. The relief is intended to encourage research into vaccines that protect against 
diseases that are particularly prevalent in the developing world. This is reflected in the 
scope of subsections (1) and (2). A clade is a type of genetic grouping. Subsection (2) 
limits relief to research into the varieties of HIV that are most common in the

2829. The clause combines the qualifying conditions that apply to small or medium- 
sized enterprises in paragraph 14 and to large companies in paragraph 21 of 
Schedule 13 to FA 2002. The amount of the relief is then given separately for each 
type of company in the following clauses. Also, clause 1092 allows a small or 
medium-sized enterprise to elect to create a trade loss in respect of pre-trading 
expenditure.

Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2833. The normal operation of clause 61 in Part 3 is suspended when allocating 
qualifying expenditure to an accounting period (see clause 1099(2)). Pre-trading 
expenditure is allocated to periods of account in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting practice and is not treated as incurred when the company starts to trade. 
 
2834. The company may be carrying on one trade and incur pre-trading expenditure 
in respect of another activity. Subsections (5) and (6) make clear that relief can be 
claimed on the pre-trading activity and given as a deduction in calculating the profits 
of the existing trade. This follows from paragraph 14(1)(b) of Schedule 13 to 
FA 2002, which requires only that the company be carrying on a trade. There is no 
requirement that the relief is given in calculating the profits of the trade for which the 
relief is given.

2836. The purpose of this modification is to keep the deduction in clause 1089 
within the European Union limit on state aid. &#8220;Larger SME&#8221; is defined in clause 1121. 
Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings) disapplies the &#8220;larger SME&#8221; category of

2839. The clause is very similar to clause 1045. A small or medium-sized enterprise 
can elect to create a trading loss in respect of pre-trading expenditure that qualifies for 
relief under this Chapter. 
 
2840. Clause 1099(1)(b) has an important role to play in the operation of this clause. 
It determines how pre-trading expenditure is allocated to accounting periods. This 
determines whether the threshold test in subsection (3) is met and the amount on 
which relief is given.

within the European Union limit on state aid. &#8220;Larger SME&#8221; is defined in clause 1121. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1094" SerialNumber="221">Clause 1094: Relief only available to SME where company is going concern 
2843. This clause sets out a precondition for relief under clauses 1087 and 1092. It is 
based on paragraph 18A of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1095" SerialNumber="222">Clause 1095: Elections under section 1092 
2844. This clause gives the procedure for making an election under clause 1092. It is 
based on paragraph 15 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1096" SerialNumber="223">Clause 1096: Treatment of deemed trading loss under section 1092 
2845. This clause imposes a restriction on the use of the trade loss and explains how 
any unused loss is to be dealt with. It is based on paragraph 15 of Schedule 13 to 
FA 2002. 
 
2846. The clause is identical in effect to clause 1048. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1097" SerialNumber="224">Clause 1097: R&#38;D threshold 
2847. This clause gives the minimum amount of expenditure that a company must 
incur in an accounting period to claim relief under this Chapter. It is based on 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2848. The minimum amount of expenditure is &#163;10,000, reduced proportionately if 
the accounting period is less than 12 months long. As in clause 1050, the source 
legislation does not explicitly state how the reduction is done. Subsection (2) removes 
any uncertainty by prescribing the arithmetic formula to be used. See Change 78 in 
Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1098" SerialNumber="225">Clause 1098: Meaning of &#8220;qualifying Chapter 7 expenditure&#8221; 
2849. This clause identifies the three categories of expenditure which qualify for 
relief. It is based on paragraph 2 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1099" SerialNumber="226">Clause 1099: SMEs: qualifying expenditure &#8220;for&#8221; an accounting period 
2850. This clause explains how qualifying expenditure is allocated to the accounting 
periods of a small or medium-sized enterprise. It is based on paragraph 2 of 
Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2851. Subsection (2) suspends the normal operation of clause 61 in Part 3 for pre- 
trading expenditure. Pre-trading expenditure is not treated as incurred on the first day 
of trading. Instead subsection (1)(b) treats the expenditure as incurred for an 
accounting period if it would have been deductible in calculating the trade profits for 
that period if the company had been trading. 
 
2852. Relief is available for pre-trading expenditure not just under clause 1092 but 
also under the main rule in clause 1089 if it can be deducted in calculating the profits 
of a trade. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1100" SerialNumber="227">Clause 1100: Large companies: qualifying expenditure &#8220;for&#8221; an accounting 
period 
2853. This clause explains how qualifying expenditure is allocated to the accounting 
periods of a large company. It is based on paragraph 2 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2854. Subsection (1) deals with in-house direct research and development and 
contracted out research and development. Expenditure is incurred for an accounting 
period if it is deductible in calculating the trade profits for that period. Unlike small or 
medium-sized enterprises the normal rules for pre-trading expenditure in clause 61 in 
Part 3 apply (see subsection (2)). Any pre-trading expenditure will be treated as 
incurred the day the company starts trading. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1101" SerialNumber="228">Clause 1101: Qualifying expenditure on in-house direct R&#38;D 
2855. This clause defines &#8220;qualifying expenditure on in-house direct research and 
development&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 3 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2856. &#8220;In-house direct research and development&#8221; is the term this Bill uses to 
describe research and development that is undertaken directly by the company. 
 
2857. Subsections (2) and (3) rewrite sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) of paragraph 3 of 
Schedule 13 to FA 2002 which refer to the expenditure being on qualifying R&#38;D 
activity. This clause refers to the expenditure being attributable to qualifying R&#38;D 
activity in order to align the language with that in Chapters 2 to 5 of this Part. 
2858. Paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 20 to FA 2000 and paragraphs 4(4) and 9(3) of 
Schedule 12 to FA 2002 all require that the qualifying expenditure is attributable to 
relevant research and development. The provisions that define particular classes of 
expenditure have rules for determining if the expenditure is attributable to relevant 
research and development. 
 
2859. Paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 13 to FA 2002 requires that the &#8220;qualifying R&#38;D 
activity on which the expenditure is incurred is relevant research and development in 
relation to the company&#8221;. This test is the same as requiring the expenditure to be 
attributable to relevant research and development and the clause adopts the language 
of the earlier Chapters. 
 
2860. The clause does not reproduce the condition in paragraph 3(4) of Schedule 13 
to FA 2002 that the expenditure is not of a capital nature. This is not necessary as 
clause 53 in Part 3 (trading income) already prohibits a deduction for capital 
expenditure. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1102" SerialNumber="229">Clause 1102: Qualifying expenditure on contracted out R&#38;D 
2861. This clause defines &#8220;qualifying expenditure on contracted out research and 
development&#8221;. It is based on paragraphs 6 and 7 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2862. The clause covers payments to a sub-contractor. The conditions in the clause 
have to be satisfied but it also necessary to isolate the sub-contractor element of the 
payment. This is described in clauses 1134 to 1136. 
 
2863. Subsections (3) and (4) also refer to the expenditure being attributable to 
qualifying R&#38;D activity. See the commentary on clause 1101. 
 
2864. The clause does not reproduce the condition in paragraph 7(5) of Schedule 13 
to FA 2002 that the expenditure is not of a capital nature. This is not necessary as 
clause 53 in Part 3 (trading income) already prohibits a deduction for capital 
expenditure. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1103" SerialNumber="230">Clause 1103: Entitlement to and payment of tax credit 
2865. This clause allows a small or medium-sized enterprise to claim an R&#38;D tax 
credit. It is based on paragraphs 16 and 18 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2866. The clause clarifies that a company may make part claims (subsection (2)). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1104" SerialNumber="231">Clause 1104: Meaning of &#8220;Chapter 7 surrenderable loss&#8221; 
2867. This clause defines &#8220;Chapter 7 surrenderable loss&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 16 
of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2868. The clause follows the same pattern as clause 1055 (meaning of &#8220;Chapter 2 
surrenderable loss&#8221;) but the restriction in subsection (2) if the claim is made by a 
trading company is slightly different. 
2869. Clause 1055(2)(b) gives relief both for the additional deduction and for the 
underlying expenditure. Subsection (2) denies relief for the underlying expenditure. 
This is because if the company has had relief under Chapter 2 it will already have had 
relief for the underlying expenditure in making an R&#38;D tax credit claim under 
clause 1055. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1105" SerialNumber="232">Clause 1105: Amount of trading loss which is &#8220;unrelieved&#8221;

It is based on paragraph 16 of Schedule 13. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1106" SerialNumber="233">Clause 1106: Tax credit only available where company is going concern

</Clause><Clause Number="1109" SerialNumber="236">Clause 1109: Payment of tax credit 
2874. This clause explains the circumstances in which the payment of an R&#38;D tax

paragraph 18 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1110" SerialNumber="237">Clause 1110: Tax credit payment not income of company 
2875. This clause makes clear that a payment of an R&#38;D tax credit is not income of 
the company for tax purposes. It is based on paragraph 20 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1111" SerialNumber="238">Clause 1111: Restriction on losses carried forward where tax credit claimed 
2876. This clause provides that any losses that are surrendered in return for an R&#38;D

Schedule 13 to FA 2002.

Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="8" SerialNumber="240">Chapter 8: Cap on aid for R&#38;D 
Overview 
2878. This Chapter sets out the rules for calculating the cap on R&#38;D aid for the 
purposes of Chapters 2 and 7. It sets out the formula for the calculation of the cap, and 
brings together the definitions of terms that constitute that formula. 
2879. Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings) preserves the transitional provision in 
paragraph 7 of Schedule 10 to FA 2008. This provides that no account is to be taken, 
for the purpose of calculating &#8220;total R&#38;D aid&#8221; in accordance with clause 1089, of any 
relief or tax credit under Chapter 2 or 7 of Part 13 in respect of expenditure incurred 
before 1 August 2008. 
 
<Clause Number="1113" SerialNumber="241">Clause 1113: Cap on R&#38;D aid under Chapter 2 or 7 
2880. This clause imposes a cap on the total amount of R&#38;D aid which may be

Schedule 10 to, FA 2008. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1114" SerialNumber="242">Clause 1114: Total R&#38;D aid

</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="9" SerialNumber="247">Chapter 9: Supplementary 
Overview 
2886. This Chapter brings together the definitions of terms that apply to each of the 
earlier Chapters. Most of these definitions are given in Schedule 20 to FA 2000 but 
they are applied to Schedules 12 and 13 to FA 2002 by the respective paragraphs 17 
and 5 of those Schedules. In such cases the commentary refers only to the 
Schedule 20 provision on which the definition is based. 
 
<Clause Number="1119" SerialNumber="248">Clause 1119: &#8220;Small or medium-sized enterprise&#8221; 
2887. This clause defines &#8220;small or medium-sized enterprise&#8221;. It is based on 
paragraph 2 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000, paragraph 2 of Schedule 12 and paragraph 5 
of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1120" SerialNumber="249">Clause 1120: Qualifications to section 1119 
2888. This clause makes two qualifications to the European Union definition of 
small or medium-sized enterprise. It is based on paragraph 2 of Schedule 20 to 
FA 2000, paragraph 2 of Schedule 12 to FA 2002 and 5 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2889. The European Union definition is in the Annex to Commission 
Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003, as incorporated by reference in 
clause 1119(1). Article 3 of the Annex requires a company to include figures from a 
partner or linked enterprise in determining whether it breaches the qualifying 
thresholds (aggregation). This is called &#8220;aggregation&#8221;. 
 
2890. Article 4(2) of the Annex gives the company a period of grace if the inclusion 
of those figures means it ceases to be a small or medium-sized enterprise. The 
company will cease to be a small or medium-sized enterprise within the European 
Union definition only if the limits are exceeded in two consecutive accounting 
periods. 
 
2891. The purpose of Qualification 2 in this clause is to remove that period of grace 
for the purposes of this Part, so that the company ceases to be a small or medium- 
sized enterprise in the second accounting period. The effect of Qualification 2 in this 
clause is to disapply Article 4(2) of the Annex so that Article 2 of the Annex applies 
instead. Article 2 of the Annex provides: &#8220;In respect of any year, you must use the 
year end accounts for that year to classify the company, according to these criteria.&#8221; 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1121" SerialNumber="250">Clause 1121: &#8220;Larger SME&#8221; 
2892. This clause defines &#8220;larger SME&#8221;. It provides a convenient label for 
companies falling within Qualification 1 of clause 1120. It is based on 
paragraphs 15A and 16A of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1122" SerialNumber="251">Clause 1122: &#8220;Large company&#8221; 
2893. This clause defines &#8220;large company&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 2 of 
Schedule 12 to FA 2002. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1123" SerialNumber="252">Clause 1123: &#8220;Staffing costs&#8221; 
2894. This clause defines &#8220;staffing costs&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 5 of Schedule 20 
to FA 2000. 
 
2895. Paragraph 5(1)(a) of Schedule 20 to FA 2000 refers to &#8220;emoluments paid by 
the company &#8230; including all salaries, wages, perquisites and profits whatsoever other 
than benefits in kind&#8221;. This is based on the definition of emoluments that section 131 
of ICTA applied for Schedule E before that Schedule was rewritten by ITEPA. 
 
2896. None of the definitions of &#8220;earnings&#8221; in ITEPA is appropriate, because none 
matches the scope of the definition in paragraph 5(1)(a) of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
2897. In rewriting Schedule 20 to FA 2000 the language has been modernised and 
the definition has been adapted so that it applies more clearly from the position of the 
company making the payment, rather than the employee receiving it. This is achieved 
by referring to money earnings and reimbursed expenses. When interpreting these 
definitions, it should be borne in mind that this Part does not create a new class of 
deduction. It merely enhances an existing staffing costs deduction, the scope of which 
is determined on ordinary principles. Before an expense can be considered for the 
purposes of this Part, it must first be deductible on ordinary principles. See for 
example clause 1050(5). 
 
2898. Subsection (2) rewrites the reference to salaries and wages by reference to 
money earnings. &#8220;Earnings&#8221; takes its ordinary meaning. The statutory definitions of 
&#8220;earnings&#8221; in ITEPA are not relevant to the scope of &#8220;earnings&#8221; in this subsection. See 
Change 79 in Annex 1. 
 
2899. Subsection (3) rewrites the reference to perquisites or profits whatsoever by 
reference to reimbursed expenses but making clear that it does not include benefits in 
kind. See Change 79 in Annex 1. 
 
2900. In subsections (2) and (3), the phrase &#8220;because of employment&#8221; is used instead 
of the ITEPA phrase &#8220;by reason of employment&#8221;. The effect is that interpretations 
developed in relation to ITEPA, which might not be appropriate to this clause, cannot 
simply be read across into this clause. 
 
2901. ITEPA amended paragraph 5 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000 so that it referred to 
earnings which constitute employment income. In doing so it inadvertently expanded 
the definition to include benefits in kind. This change was reversed by paragraph 7 of 
Schedule 17 to FA 2004, which reinstated the original wording. Schedule 2 
(transitionals and savings) preserves the wider definition inserted by ITEPA for the 
brief window in which it applies to accounting periods covered by this Bill. It is 
relevant only to expenditure incurred before 1 April 2004. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1124" SerialNumber="253">Clause 1124: Staffing costs: attributable expenditure 
2902. This clause identifies when staffing costs are attributable to relevant research 
and development. It is based on paragraph 5 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
2903. In subsection (4) and in clauses 1126(4) and 1132(4) the phrase &#8220;appropriate 
proportion&#8221; is used, while in clauses 1129(7), 1134(6) and 1138(4) the concept of a 
just and reasonable apportionment is used. The two phrases have different meanings 
and are used in different circumstances. &#8220;Appropriate proportion&#8221; is used where the 
quantities or qualities to be determined are objectively measurable. &#8220;Just and 
reasonable&#8221; is used where the quantities to be determined are not objectively 
measurable and the apportionment exercise requires a measure of subjectivity. 
 
2904. When the legislation was introduced the test was that 80% of the director or 
employee&#8217;s working time had to be spent on relevant research and development. 
Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings) preserves this for pre-trading expenditure 
treated as incurred in the accounting periods to which this Bill applies. It is relevant 
only to expenditure incurred before 9 April 2003 (Chapters 3 and 5) and 27 
September 2003 (Chapters 2 and 7). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1125" SerialNumber="254">Clause 1125: &#8220;Software or consumable items&#8221; 
2905. This clause defines &#8220;software or consumable items&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 6 
of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
2906. When the legislation was introduced relief under all the Chapters in this Part 
was given for expenditure on &#8220;consumable stores&#8221;. Schedule 2 (transitionals and 
savings) preserves this for pre-trading expenditure treated as incurred in the 
accounting periods to which this Bill applies. It is relevant only to expenditure 
incurred before 1 April 2004. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1126" SerialNumber="255">Clause 1126: Software or consumable items: attributable expenditure 
2907. This clause identifies when expenditure on software or consumable items is 
attributable to relevant research and development. It is based on paragraph 6 of 
Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1127" SerialNumber="256">Clause 1127: &#8220;Qualifying expenditure on externally provided workers&#8221; 
2908. This clause defines &#8220;qualifying expenditure on externally provided workers&#8221;. 
It is based on paragraph 8A of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
2909. This clause is the first of six clauses that deal with the relief given in relation 
to expenditure on externally provided workers. Clauses 1129 to 1131 explain how to 
calculate this amount. These clauses focus on the subject matter of the expenditure. 
Clause 1132 then identifies whether that expenditure is incurred on relevant research 
and development. 
 
2910. The relief applies only to expenditure incurred on or after 9 April 2003 
(Chapters 3 and 5) or 27 September 2003 (Chapters 2, 4 and 7). Schedule 2 
(transitionals and savings) preserves this for pre-trading expenditure treated as 
incurred in the accounting periods to which this Bill applies. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1128" SerialNumber="257">Clause 1128: &#8220;Externally provided worker&#8221; 
2911. This clause defines &#8220;externally provided worker&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 8B 
of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1129" SerialNumber="258">Clause 1129: Qualifying expenditure on externally provided workers: connected 
persons 
2912. This clause gives the amount of the qualifying expenditure if the company and 
the staff provider are connected. It is based on paragraph 8C of Schedule 20 to 
FA 2000. 
2913. The definition of connected persons in section 839 of ICTA (applied by 
clause 1316(1)) applies. 
 
2914. Subsection (3) defines &#8220;relevant expenditure&#8221;. It provides for the exclusion for 
expenditure of a capital nature that is omitted in the rewrite of other provisions of the 
source legislation for this Part. Clause 53 in Part 3 (trading income), which denies a 
deduction for capital expenditure, applies to determine if the expenditure would be 
deductible in calculating the trading profits. It would not apply to exclude capital 
expenditure from the staff provider&#8217;s actual relevant expenditure. 
 
2915. The definition of &#8220;agency workers&#8217; remuneration&#8221; in subsection (6) omits the 
reference to section 134 of ICTA in paragraph 8C(4)(b) of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
The ICTA provision was repealed by ITEPA and the cross-reference is no longer 
required. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1130" SerialNumber="259">Clause 1130: Election for connected persons treatment 
2916. This clause allows a company and a staff provider who are not connected to 
elect for connected persons treatment. It is based on paragraph 8D of Schedule 20 to 
FA 2000. 
 
2917. The word &#8220;other&#8221; in subsection (2) does not appear in paragraph 8D(2) of 
Schedule 20 to FA 2000 (the source for this subsection). It does appear in a similar 
context in paragraph 11(2) of Schedule 20 (the source for clause 1131(2)). The 
inclusion of the word in subsection (2) of this clause promotes consistency without 
changing the meaning of the law. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1131" SerialNumber="260">Clause 1131: Qualifying expenditure on externally provided workers: other cases 
2918. This clause identifies the amount of the qualifying expenditure if the company 
and staff provider are not connected and have not made an election under clause 1130. 
It is based on paragraph 8E of Schedule 20 to FA 2000. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1132" SerialNumber="261">Clause 1132: External workers: attributable expenditure 
2919. This clause identifies when qualifying expenditure on externally provided 
workers is attributable to relevant R&#38;D. It is based on paragraph 8A of Schedule 20 
to FA 2000. 
 
2920. The clause follows the pattern of clause 1124 which performs a similar 
function for staffing costs. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1133" SerialNumber="262">Clause 1133: &#8220;Sub-contractor&#8221; and &#8220;sub-contractor payment&#8221; 
2921. This clause defines &#8220;sub-contractor&#8221; and &#8220;sub-contractor payment&#8221;. It is based 
on paragraph 9 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000 and paragraph 6 of Schedule 13 to 
FA 2002. 
2922. This clause is the first of a group of clauses that apply to sub-contractor 
payments. The clauses are very similar to those that apply to qualifying expenditure 
on externally provided workers. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1134" SerialNumber="263">Clause 1134: Qualifying element of sub-contractor payment: connected persons 
2923. This clause identifies the qualifying element of a sub-contractor payment if the 
company and the sub-contractor are connected persons. It is based on paragraph 10 of

corporation tax. It is based on paragraph 25 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000 and 
paragraph 27 of Schedule 13 to FA 2002. 
 
2930. An accounting period is the basis for the determination of tax liability. If a 
company does not have an accounting period, or is not deemed to have one, then that 
company will not be able to perform the calculations which are necessary for it to take 
advantage of the provisions in clauses 1045 and 1092. Those clauses allow a company 
to elect to create a loss in respect of pre-trading expenditure. A company that is not 
yet trading may not have an accounting period. Clauses 1045 and 1092 operate by 
reference to accounting periods. This clause treats the company as having the 
accounting periods it would have had if it had been trading when it incurred the

on the remediation of contaminated land. It is based on Schedule 22 to FA 2001. 
 
2938. Relief under the Part is given as a deduction in calculating the company&#8217;s 
trade profits or the profits of a UK property business carried on by the company.

</Clause><Clause Number="1146" SerialNumber="277">Clause 1146: &#8220;Relevant land remediation&#8221; 
2942. This clause identifies the activities that make up &#8220;relevant land remediation&#8221;. 
It is based on paragraph 4 of Schedule 22 to FA 2001. 
 
2943. &#8220;Relevant land remediation&#8221; can either be the remediation activity itself or 
activities in preparation for the remediation activity, see subsection (1). &#8220;Relevant 
preparatory activity&#8221; comes within the definition of &#8220;relevant land remediation&#8221; only 
if it leads to remediation activity being carried out, see subsection (4)(b). 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="2" SerialNumber="278">Chapter 2: Reliefs for expenditure on contaminated land 
<Clause Number="1147" SerialNumber="279">Clause 1147: Deduction for capital expenditure 
2944. This clause gives the company a deduction for capital expenditure included in 
qualifying land remediation expenditure subject to certain conditions. It is based on 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 22 to FA 2001. 
 
2945. The company must elect to make the deduction. The procedure for making the 
election is in clause 1148. 
 
2946. Capital expenditure is not defined. It is expenditure for which a deduction 
would normally be denied by clause 53. But this clause permits a deduction for capital 
expenditure in calculating the profits of a trade or UK property business of a company 
in spite of the rule in clause 53. 
 
2947. The existence of clause 53 means it is not necessary to rewrite 
paragraph 1(4)(a) of Schedule 22 to FA 2001. That provision denies relief for 
expenditure that has already been allowed as a deduction in calculating the profits of a 
trade or of a UK property business carried on by the company. It is not needed if there 
is already a specific rule preventing a deduction for such expenditure. 
 
2948. Subsection (7) is a similar provision to clause 61. It treats capital expenditure 
incurred on contaminated land that will be used for the purposes of a trade or UK 
property business as incurred on the day the trade or business starts. Unlike clause 61 
there is no time limit on how far in advance of the trade or business starting the 
expenditure must be incurred.

2950. This clause entitles a company to make a claim increasing the deduction given 
in calculating its trade or UK property business profits if certain conditions are met. It 
is based on paragraphs 12 and 13 of Schedule 22 to FA 2001. 
 
2951. Subsection (1) is a further example of Change 77 in Annex 1 where it is made 
clear that the additional relief applies only for corporation tax. 
 
2952. This clause applies to expenditure that is allowed as a deduction in computing 
taxable profits either as a normal revenue deduction or through the operation of 
clause 1147. The relief increases the amount of the deduction by 50%. 
 
2953. The additional deduction has to be claimed. There is no special procedure for 
making the claim. The ordinary rules in Part 7 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 apply.

&#8220;qualifying land remediation loss&#8221;. It is based on paragraphs 14 and 16 of 
Schedule 22 to FA 2001. 
 
2956. The clause clarifies that a company may make part claims (subsection (2)). 
This is in line with current HMRC policy and is supported by paragraph 17(5)(b) of 
Schedule 22 to FA 2001. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1152" SerialNumber="285">Clause 1152: Meaning of &#8220;qualifying land remediation loss&#8221; 
2957. This clause defines &#8220;qualifying land remediation loss&#8221;. It is based on 
paragraph 14 of Schedule 22 to FA 2001. 
 
2958. Subsection (2) limits the amount of the qualifying land remediation loss to the 
lesser of two amounts. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1153" SerialNumber="286">Clause 1153: Amount of a loss which is &#8220;unrelieved&#8221;

FA 2001. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1154" SerialNumber="287">Clause 1154: Amount of tax credit

2961. This clause gives a number of administrative rules that affect the payment of a

</Clause><Clause Number="1156" SerialNumber="289">Clause 1156: Tax credit payment not income of company 
2962. This clause states that the payment of a land remediation tax credit is not 
income of the company for any tax purposes. It is based on paragraph 18 of 
Schedule 22 to FA 2001. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1157" SerialNumber="290">Clause 1157: Exclusion for capital gains purposes of certain expenditure 
2963. This clause prevents any expenditure for which a land remediation tax credit 
has been claimed from also being deducted in the calculation of any chargeable gain 
on the disposal of the land. It is based on paragraph 19 of Schedule 22 to FA 2001. 
 
2964. Section 39 of TCGA prevents expenditure that is allowable as a deduction in 
calculating income tax profits from being deducted again in the calculation of the 
chargeable gain. Section 8(3) and (4) of TCGA applies this principle to the calculation 
of a company&#8217;s income and chargeable gains. 
 
2965. The ordinary operation of section 39 of TCGA will prevent a double deduction 
for expenditure which attracts relief under clauses 1147 and 1149. Amounts allowed 
under those clauses will be deducted in calculating the company&#8217;s profits charged to 
corporation tax. But it is arguable that a loss surrendered in return for the payment of 
a land remediation tax credit falls outside this rule as the loss is not used in the 
ordinary calculation of the company&#8217;s profits. 
 
2966. This clause makes clear that expenditure that contributed to the surrendered 
qualifying land remediation loss is not deductible in calculating the chargeable gain or 
allowable loss on the disposal of the land. It is not necessary to apply the rule to the 
50% additional deduction itself as it is a notional figure and not an amount of actual 
expenditure.

<Clause Number="1170" SerialNumber="306">Clause 1170: &#8220;Staffing costs&#8221; 
2981. This clause gives the meaning of staffing costs. It is based on paragraph 5 of 
Schedule 22 to FA 2001. That paragraph uses the term &#8220;employee costs&#8221;, but in 
rewriting the source legislation it was felt that the term &#8220;staffing costs&#8221;, which is the 
term used for the equivalent purpose in Part 13 of the Bill, was more appropriate. 
 
2982. Paragraph 5(1)(a) of Schedule 22 to FA 2001 refers to &#8220;emoluments paid by 
the company &#8230; including all salaries, wages, perquisites and profits whatsoever other 
than benefits in kind&#8221;. This is based on the definition of emoluments that section 131 
of ICTA applied for Schedule E before that Schedule was rewritten by ITEPA. 
 
2983. ITEPA amended paragraph 5 of Schedule 20 to FA 2000 so that it referred to 
earnings which constitute employment income. In doing so it inadvertently expanded 
the definition to include benefits in kind. This change was reversed by paragraph 7 of 
Schedule 17 to FA 2004, which reinstated the original wording. 
 
2984. In rewriting Schedule 22 to FA 2001 it was decided that the language and 
format of the definition should be adapted so that the definition applies more clearly 
from the position of the company making the payment rather than the employee 
receiving it. Hence the reference to money earnings and reimbursed expenses. 
 
2985. Subsection (2) rewrites the reference to salaries and wages by reference to 
money earnings. Subsection (3) rewrites the reference to perquisites and profits by 
reference to reimbursed expenses. See Change 79 in Annex 1. 
2986. Paragraph 5(1)(c) of Schedule 22 to FA 2001 refers to &#8220;contributions paid by 
the company to any pension fund (within the meaning of section 231A(4) of 
[ICTA])&#8221;. Section 231A of ICTA was repealed by F(No 2)A 1997 with effect for 
distributions made on or after 6 April 1999. But a consequential amendment was not 
made to paragraph 5 of Schedule 22 so as to set out in full the definition of &#8220;pension 
fund&#8221;. 
 
2987. The parallel definition in paragraph 5(1)(c) of Schedule 20 to FA 2000 also 
used to refer to section 231A(4) of ICTA. It was amended by paragraph 3 of 
Schedule 15 to FA 2002. The wording of the definition is the same but it is now free- 
standing. Subsection (6) provides a freestanding definition of &#8220;pension fund&#8221; that

substituted by paragraph 17 of Schedule 5 to FA 2006. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1182" SerialNumber="320">Clause 1182: &#8220;Film production company&#8221; 
3005. This clause defines &#8220;film production company&#8221; for this Part. It is based on 
section 32 of FA 2006. 
 
3006. There can be at most one company that fits the description of &#8220;film production 
company&#8221; in relation to a particular film. There may be no such company. A company 
might be a film production company in relation to some of the films that it is involved 
with but not in relation to others. 
 
3007. If a company is the film production company in relation to a particular film its 
production and exploitation activities in relation to the film are, for corporation tax 
purposes, treated as a separate trade (see Chapter 2: taxation of activities of film 
production company). A film production company may, but need not, be entitled to 
additional reliefs in relation to the film concerned (see Chapter 3: film tax relief). 
 
3008. Subsection (7) provides for a company to elect that it is not to be treated as a 
film production company in relation to films. Such an election is likely to be helpful 
to companies that are not entitled to additional reliefs in relation to films that they are 
involved with. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1183" SerialNumber="321">Clause 1183: &#8220;Film-making activities&#8221; etc 
3009. This clause gives the meaning of &#8220;film-making activities&#8221; for this Part and 
gives the Treasury power to make regulations that alter the meaning. It is based on 
section 33 of FA 2006. 
 
3010. The activities mentioned in subsection (1) are not further defined. Those 
activities are however well understood in the film industry. 
 
3011. Subsection (2) ensures that principal photography has an appropriate meaning 
in cases where images for a film are generated by computer.

3012. This clause defines the terms &#8220;production expenditure&#8221;, &#8220;core expenditure&#8221; 
and &#8220;limited-budget film&#8221;. It is based on section 34 of FA 2006. 
 
3013. Limited-budget films are eligible for more generous reliefs than other films 
(see clauses 1200(3) and 1202(3)). To reduce the risk of exploitation by arrangements 
involving connected parties, subsection (3) substitutes, in certain cases, (greater) arms 
length prices in determining whether a film is a limited-budget film. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1185" SerialNumber="323">Clause 1185: &#8220;UK expenditure&#8221; etc 
3014. This clause gives the meaning of &#8220;UK expenditure&#8221; in this Part and gives the 
Treasury power to make regulations that alter the meaning. It is based on section 35 of 
FA 2006. 
3015. Subsection (2) provides that any apportionment of expenditure be made on a 
&#8220;just and reasonable basis&#8221;. The source legislation refers to &#8220;fair and reasonable&#8221;. The 
formulation used in this clause has generally been adopted in ITTOIA and ITA. See

3016. This clause defines &#8220;qualifying co-production&#8221; and &#8220;co-producer&#8221; for this 
Part. It is based on section 36 of FA 2006. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1187" SerialNumber="325">Clause 1187: &#8220;Company tax return&#8221; 
3017. This clause defines &#8220;company tax return&#8221;. It is based on section 32(10) of 
FA 2006. 
 
3018. Whilst the definition in section 32(10) of FA 2006 is not explicitly applied to 
instances where the term &#8220;company tax return&#8221; appears in Schedules 4 and 5 to 
FA 2006, it is considered that the same meaning applies in those instances. So the 
definition in this clause applies to the whole Part.

<Clause Number="1188" SerialNumber="327">Clause 1188: Activities of film production company treated as a separate trade 
3019. This clause treats a film production company&#8217;s activities in relation to the film 
as a separate trade for corporation tax purposes and provides for when that trade is 
treated as starting. It is based on section 37 of, and paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 4 
to, FA 2006. 
 
3020. Subsection (3) introduces the label &#8220;the separate film trade&#8221; in this Chapter as 
a means of avoiding cumbersome references such as &#8220;the separate trade that a film 
production company is treated as carrying on in relation to the film in respect of 
which it is the film production company&#8221;. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1189" SerialNumber="328">Clause 1189: Calculation of profits or losses of separate film trade 
3021. This clause provides rules for bringing into account income from the film (as 
defined) and costs of the film (as defined) in calculating the profit or loss of the 
separate film trade for a period of account. It is based on paragraph 7 of Schedule 4 to 
FA 2006. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1190" SerialNumber="329">Clause 1190: Income from the film 
3022. This clause gives the meaning in this Chapter of the term &#8220;income from the 
film&#8221;. It is based on paragraph 6 of Schedule 4 to FA 2006. 
 
3023. Subsection (3) provides that capital receipts are treated as having a revenue 
nature for this purpose. So, for instance, all receipts from the sale of the film will be 
treated as income for the purposes of this clause. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1191" SerialNumber="330">Clause 1191: Costs of the film 
3024. This clause gives the meaning in this Chapter of the term &#8220;costs of the film&#8221;. It 
is based on paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 to FA 2006. 
 
3025. Subsection (3) prevents expenditure being treated as capital purely because it 
is on the creation of the film. It does not therefore apply to, say, capital expenditure on 
plant and machinery since that would be capital regardless of the creation of the film. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1192" SerialNumber="331">Clause 1192: When costs are taken to be incurred 
3026. This clause makes provision about when costs are taken to be incurred. It is 
based on paragraph 9 of Schedule 4 to FA 2006. 
 
3027. To prevent avoidance costs are, for instance, not to be treated as incurred 
before they are the subject of an unconditional obligation and are reflected in the state 
of completion of the work in progress. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1193" SerialNumber="332">Clause 1193: Pre-trading expenditure 
3028. This clause allows expenditure incurred on development of the film, but 
before the separate film trade starts, to be treated as incurred immediately after the 
separate film trade starts. It is based on paragraph 4 of Schedule 4 to FA 2006. 
 
3029. If pre-trading expenditure is treated in this fashion, the company must amend 
any company tax returns that have previously taken account of the same expenditure.

and 11 of Schedule 5 to FA 2006. 
 
3041. Subsection (3) provides for a higher payable credit rate if the film is a

on paragraphs 9, 10 and 14 of Schedule 5 to FA 2006. 
3044. Various circumstances in which a payment need not be made are set out. 
These include cases where the company has not yet made certain payments that it is

FA 2006. 
 
3047. The restriction in this clause is additional to that in clause 1192. Clause 1192 
is concerned with whether, and when, a trading deduction may be made in respect of 
expenditure in calculating the profit or loss of the single film trade. The further

FA 2006. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1209" SerialNumber="350">Clause 1209: Restriction on use of losses while film in production 
3053. This clause restricts the offset of single film trade losses arising in accounting 
periods ending before the film is completed or abandoned (&#8220;pre-completion periods&#8221;). 
It is based on section 43(1) and (2) of FA 2006. 
 
3054. The profits against which pre-completion period single film trade losses can be 
offset are restricted to those provided for by section 393(1) of ICTA (carry forward 
against trading profits of the same trade). But this restriction may effectively cease to 
apply in respect of some, or all, of those single film trade losses from the accounting 
period in which the film is completed or abandoned (see clause 1210). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1210" SerialNumber="351">Clause 1210: Use of losses in later periods 
3055. This clause modifies, for accounting periods from that in which the film is 
completed or abandoned (&#8220;the completion period&#8221;), the rules on trade losses and their 
offset against other profits. It is based on section 44(1) to (4) and (6) of FA 2006. 
 
3056. Subsection (1)(b) refers to the separate film trade continuing in accounting 
periods after the completion period. This deals with the possibility that a film 
production company might decide to exploit the completed film, rather than sell it. In 
such a case the separate film trade may continue after the completion period. 
 
3057. Subsections (2) and (3) allow part (or all) of single film trade losses brought 
forward to the completion period to be treated as if they were single film trade losses 
of the completion period. Single film trade losses of the completion period are not 
subject to the restrictions in clause 1209. Any brought forward losses that are 
attributable to film tax relief (see subsection (6)) will not be &#8220;freed-up&#8221; in this 
manner. Nor will losses be &#8220;freed-up&#8221; if they are brought forward because of 
clause 1211 (terminal losses) (see subsection (7)). 
 
3058. Subsections (4) and (5) prevent single film trade losses being offset against 
other profits to the extent that such losses are attributable to film tax relief (see 
subsection (6)).

3059. This clause allows certain single film trade losses, attributable to a trade that

trades and it allows the Treasury to make regulations appropriate to the operation of 
the clause. It is based on section 45 of FA 2006. 
3060. The normal rule is that trade losses do not survive the cessation of the trade in 
which the losses were made. This clause operates if the trade that ceases (trade A) is a 
single film trade that qualifies for film tax relief and, at the time of cessation, there is 
another single film trade (trade B) carried on which also qualifies for film tax relief. 
Subject to conditions being met, the losses of trade A that would otherwise have been 
available for carry forward under section 393(1) of ICTA may be treated as if they 
were losses of trade B that are carried forward under section 393(1) of ICTA.

carried on trade A or by another member of the same group (for group relief) as that 
film production company.

Overview 
3063. It may not be established that a film qualifies for film tax relief, or transfer of 
terminal losses, until the accounting period in which the film is completed or 
abandoned (&#8220;the final accounting period&#8221;). This Chapter provides for film tax relief to 
be obtained, or terminal losses transferred, for earlier accounting periods (&#8220;interim 
accounting periods&#8221;) on the basis of provisional assumptions and for later adjustments 
where those assumptions are wrong. 
 
<Clause Number="1212" SerialNumber="354">Clause 1212: Introduction 
3064. This clause defines terms used in the Chapter and requires the appropriate 
company tax return of the film production company to state that the film has been 
completed or abandoned. It is based on paragraph 30 of Schedule 5 to FA 2006. 
 
3065. The term &#8220;special film relief&#8221; covers both film tax relief (which requires that 
the film in question satisfy the requirements listed in clause 1195(2)) and the transfer 
of terminal losses (which requires that both of the films in question satisfy those 
requirements). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1213" SerialNumber="355">Clause 1213: Certification as a British film 
3066. This clause relates to the requirement that a film must be certified as a British 
film in order for there to be entitlement to special film relief. It is based on 
paragraph 31 of Schedule 5 to FA 2006. 
 
3067. Special film relief cannot be claimed for an interim accounting period unless 
the company tax return is accompanied by an interim certificate. For the final 
accounting period the company tax return must be accompanied by a final certificate 
or, if the film was abandoned rather than completed, an interim certificate. Special 
film relief previously obtained is withdrawn if the conditions in this clause are not 
met. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1214" SerialNumber="356">Clause 1214: The UK expenditure condition 
3068. This clause relates to the requirement that a film must meet the UK 
expenditure condition in order for there to be entitlement to special film relief. It is 
based on paragraph 32 of Schedule 5 to FA 2006. 
 
3069. Special film relief cannot be claimed for an interim accounting period unless 
the company tax return indicates that the UK expenditure condition will be met. For 
the final accounting period the company tax return must show that the UK 
expenditure condition is met. Special film relief previously obtained is withdrawn if 
the conditions in this clause are not met. 
 
3070. Subsection (3) does not rewrite the requirement, in paragraph 32(3)(a)(i) of 
Schedule 5 to FA 2006, that the company&#8217;s tax return for the final accounting period 
state that the film has been completed or abandoned. That is because it duplicates the 
requirement in paragraph 30(2) of Schedule 5 to FA 2006 (rewritten in 
clause 1212(2)). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1215" SerialNumber="357">Clause 1215: Film tax relief on basis that film is limited-budget film 
3071. This clause relates to the requirement that a film must be a limited-budget film 
in order for there to be entitlement to film tax relief at the enhanced rates in 
clauses 1200(3)(a) and 1202(3)(a). It is based on paragraph 33 of Schedule 5 to 
FA 2006. 
 
3072. Film tax relief at an enhanced rate cannot be claimed for an interim accounting 
period unless the company tax return indicates that the film will be a limited-budget 
film. For the final accounting period the company tax return must show that the film 
is, or if it had been completed would have been, a limited-budget film. Film tax relief 
previously obtained at an enhanced rate tax relief is reduced if the conditions in this 
clause are not met. 
 
3073. Subsection (3) does not rewrite the requirement, in paragraph 33(3)(a)(i) of 
Schedule 5 to FA 2006, that the company&#8217;s tax return for the final accounting period 
state that the film has been completed or abandoned. That is because it duplicates the

clause 1212(2)).

Overview 
3075. Expenses of management (generally known as &#8220;management expenses&#8221;) are 
designed to give relief for the cost of managing an investment business on broadly the 
same basis as relief for trading expenses or expenses of a property business. 
3076. Originally relief was given for expenses &#8220;disbursed&#8221; but changes in 2004 
brought the relief (and the recovery of relief) more closely into line with the treatment 
of the corresponding items in a company&#8217;s accounts. So, for instance, clauses 1225 
and 1231 rely on the concept of &#8220;generally accepted accounting practice&#8221;. 
 
<Chapter Number="1" SerialNumber="360">Chapter 1: Introduction 
<Clause Number="1217" SerialNumber="361">Clause 1217: Overview of Part 
3077. This clause introduces the Part. It is new. 
 
3078. This Bill does not rewrite section 76 of ICTA (expenses of insurance 
companies). Instead, it inserts sections 76ZA to 76ZO into ICTA, to provide a version 
of the trading income rules adapted to insurance companies to which section 76 of 
ICTA applies. For companies carrying on life assurance business, but not charged in 
accordance with the trading income rules, this Part does not apply. Instead, the rules 
in section 76 apply. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1218" SerialNumber="362">Clause 1218: &#8220;Company with investment business&#8221; and &#8220;investment business&#8221; 
3079. This clause sets out which companies are within the rules in this Part of the 
Bill. It is based on sections 75 and 130 of ICTA. 
 
3080. Subsection (2) is the rule that a credit union is not a company with investment 
business. 
 
3081. The rule applies for the purposes of this Part of the Bill. So there is no 
possibility of a charge on a credit union under clause 1254 on a FISMA repayment. 
See Change 80 in Annex 1. 
 
3082. Subsection (3) is a signpost to clause 1219(2) which restricts the application of 
this Part of the Bill to the part of the company&#8217;s business which is an investment 
business. But that restriction does not affect the basic definition of a &#8220;company with 
investment business&#8221;. 
 
3083. Schedule 1 to this Bill amends section 18 of CAA so that &#8220;managing the 
investments of a company with investment business&#8221; in section 15(1)(g) of CAA is 
defined by reference to clauses 1218 and 1219 of the Bill. So there is no need for a 
separate rule to the effect that a credit union is not a company with investment 
business for the purposes of CAA. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="2" SerialNumber="363">Chapter 2: Management expenses 
<Clause Number="1219" SerialNumber="364">Clause 1219: Expenses of management of a company&#8217;s investment business 
3084. This clause sets out what are &#8220;expenses of management&#8221;. It is based on 
section 75 of ICTA. 
 
3085. There is no explicit definition of &#8220;expenses of management&#8221; either in the 
source legislation or in this Bill. Instead, the limits of the expression are set by: 
    &#8226; case law, in which the expression (retained in this Bill) has been considered; 
 
    &#8226; general exclusions set out in this clause; 
 
    &#8226; specific reliefs set out in Chapter 3 of this Part; and 
 
    &#8226; specific restrictions set out in Chapter 4 of this Part. 
 
3086. Subsection (1) ties the expenses to the management of the company&#8217;s 
investment business (defined in clause 1218), and to the accounting period to which 
the expenses are &#8220;referable&#8221; (see clause 1224). 
 
3087. The clause provides that the expenses are &#8220;allowed as a deduction&#8221;, echoing 
the words of Part 3 (trading income). HMRC guidance (see paragraph 8580 of the 
Company Taxation Manual) suggests that the deduction of management expenses is 
mandatory. But this amounts to the same thing. 
 
3088. Both restrictions in subsection (2) apply for the purposes of this Part (see 
clause 1218). 
 
3089. Subsection (3) excludes capital expenditure, in terms that follow closely the 
trading income rule. It also prevents a deduction as management expenses for 
anything that is otherwise allowable for tax purposes. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1220" SerialNumber="365">Clause 1220: Meaning of &#8220;unallowable purpose&#8221;

clause 1219(2)(b). It is based on section 75 of ICTA. 
 
3091. Subsection (1) is the basic rule that explains the ordinary meaning of 
&#8220;unallowable purpose&#8221;. 
 
3092. Subsection (2) extends &#8220;unallowable purpose&#8221; to include investments held in

3093. This clause makes clear the relationship between two of the rules in 
clause 1219 and rules elsewhere in this Part. It is based on section 75 of ICTA. 
 
3094. The rule in clause 1219(3)(a) which excludes capital expenditure is not applied 
to a rule that treats an amount as an expense of management. 
 
3095. Similarly, the rule in clause 1219(2) that expenses must be &#8220;in respect of&#8221; the 
company&#8217;s investment business is not applied to a rule that makes an amount 
deductible as an expense of management. See Change 81 in Annex 1.

overridden by a specific timing rule elsewhere. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1225" SerialNumber="370">Clause 1225: Accounts conforming with GAAP 
3100. This clause gives the timing rule in the two most common cases. It is based on 
section 75A of ICTA. 
 
3101. Subsection (1) deals with the first most common case. The management 
expenses are &#8220;referable to&#8221; the accounting period for which accounts are drawn up in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting practice (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). GAAP is defined 
in section 50(1) of FA 2004. 
 
3102. UK generally accepted accounting practice is defined in section 50(4) of 
FA 2004. 
 
3103. Subsection (2) deals with the second most common case. GAAP accounts are 
drawn up. But the period of the accounts does not coincide with the company&#8217;s 
accounting period. The expenses are apportioned. 
 
3104. Subsection (3) sets out the basis of apportionment. It retains the words &#8220;it 
appears that&#8221; because they may make the test easier to meet than an apparently 
objective test (&#8220;if the method would work unreasonably &#8230;&#8221;). But the second 
&#8220;appears&#8221; in section 75A(5) of ICTA (&#8220;such other method &#8230; as appears just and 
reasonable&#8221;) is dropped as it adds nothing. So the wording here is consistent with 
other &#8220;just and reasonable&#8221; apportionments in the Bill. The same point arises in 
connection with clause 1229(6). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1226" SerialNumber="371">Clause 1226: Accounts not conforming with GAAP

</Clause><Clause Number="1227" SerialNumber="372">Clause 1227: Accounts not drawn up 
3106. This clause gives the timing rule if there are no accounts. It is based on 
section 75A(7) and (8) of ICTA. 
3107. The rule is that the management expenses are &#8220;referable to&#8221; the accounting 
period into which they would have fallen if GAAP accounts had been drawn up. 
 
3108. There are alternative definitions of GAAP in section 50 of FA 2004. 
International standards apply if the company &#8220;prepares accounts in accordance with 
international accounting standards&#8221;. In any other case (including the case where no 
accounts are prepared), the United Kingdom standard (UK GAAP) applies. 
 
3109. The combined effect of section 50(1) and (4) of FA 2004 is that in 
section 75A(8) GAAP means UK GAAP. A similar point arises in clause 1231. In

accounts to accounting periods. 
 
3113. Subsection (6) sets out the basis of apportionment. It retains the words &#8220;it

accounts for the company&#8217;s accounting period. 
 
3118. There are alternative definitions of GAAP in section 50 of FA 2004. 
International standards apply if the company &#8220;prepares accounts in accordance with 
international accounting standards&#8221;. In any other case (including the case where no 
accounts are prepared), UK GAAP applies. 
 
3119. The combined effect of section 50(1) and (4) of FA 2004 is that in 
section 75B(10) GAAP means UK GAAP. A similar point arises in clause 1227. In 
each case the clause specifies UK GAAP.

3120. This clause is a priority rule. It is based on section 75 of ICTA. 
 
3121. If an expense falls within the general rule for management expenses in 
clause 1219(1) that clause takes priority over the rules in this Chapter. And if an 
expense is otherwise deductible for tax purposes the rules in this Chapter do not apply 
to it. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1233" SerialNumber="379">Clause 1233: Excess capital allowances 
3122. This clause gives a deduction for some capital allowances. It is based on 
section 75 of ICTA. 
 
3123. A company with an investment business carries on a &#8220;qualifying activity&#8221; (see 
section 15(1)(g) of CAA). The rule in section 253 of CAA is that capital allowances 
are to be deducted in calculating the profits of the business. But, if there is an excess 
of allowances, the excess is treated as management expenses and can be set against 
profits generally. 
 
Clauses 1234 to 1246 
Overview 
3124. The following 13 clauses are equivalent to trading income clauses. 
 
3125. Generally there are no timing rules in the clauses. So a deduction is made in 
the accounting period to which it is &#8220;referable&#8221; in accordance with clause 1224. There 
are two exceptions: clauses 1240(4) and 1242(4) require the deduction for a 
redundancy payment to be made in the final accounting period of the business if the 
payment is made after the business has ceased. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1234" SerialNumber="380">Clause 1234: Payments for restrictive undertakings 
3126. This clause allows a company to deduct certain amounts paid to employees for 
restrictive undertakings. It is based on section 73 of FA 1988. The corresponding rule 
for trading income is in clause 69. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1235" SerialNumber="381">Clause 1235: Employees seconded to charities and educational establishments 
3127. This clause allows a company carrying on investment business to deduct the 
cost of an employee seconded to a charity or educational establishment. It is based on 
section 86 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for trading income is in clause 70. 
 
3128. The rule in section 86 of ICTA is that the cost of the employee &#8220;shall continue 
to be deductible in the manner and to the like extent&#8221; as if the employee continued to 
work in the employer&#8217;s business. This clause allows the employer to deduct all costs 
attributable to the seconded employee during the period of the secondment, regardless 
of whether those costs would have been allowed if the employee had not been 
seconded. See Change 14 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1236" SerialNumber="382">Clause 1236: Payroll deduction schemes 
3129. This clause allows an employer a deduction for expenses incurred in operating 
the payroll deduction scheme. It is based on section 86A of ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for trading income is in clause 72. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1237" SerialNumber="383">Clause 1237: Counselling and other outplacement services 
3130. This clause gives a deduction for certain expenses of counselling provided for 
employees. It is based on section 589A of ICTA. The corresponding rule for trading 
income is in clause 73. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1238" SerialNumber="384">Clause 1238: Retraining courses 
3131. This clause gives a deduction for certain expenses of retraining provided for 
employees. It is based on section 588 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for trading 
income is in clause 74. 
 
3132. The clause does not rewrite section 588(3)(b) of ICTA. That provision makes 
a deduction as a management expense conditional on the employee&#8217;s exemption under 
section 311 of ITEPA in respect of the expenditure in question. This condition is not 
consistent with the similar provision in clause 1237 and does not serve any material 
purpose. See Change 16 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><ClauseRange start="1239" end="1243">Clauses 1239 to 1243: Redundancy payments etc 
3133. These five clauses are based on sections 90, 579 and 580 of ICTA. The parts 
of the rules that deal with the employee&#8217;s liability are in section 309 of ITEPA. The 
corresponding rules for trading income are in clauses 76 to 81. 
 
Timing 
3134. In clauses 1240(4) and 1242(4) there is a special timing rule for management 
expenses. For trading income the Bill adopts a &#8220;person-based&#8221; approach. So the 
corresponding trading income rules refer to a &#8220;payment &#8230; made after the employer 
has permanently ceased to carry on the trade [or part of the trade]&#8221;. 
 
3135. In these clauses the rules refer to a payment &#8220;referable to &#8230; an accounting 
period beginning after the business [or the part of the business] has [permanently] 
ceased to be carried on&#8221;. This produces the same result as the trading income clauses, 
without the need to explain the rule for businesses carried on in partnership. 
 
3136. If an investment business ceases, the closing words of the second sentence of 
section 90(1) and section 579(3A) of ICTA make the payments referable to the 
&#8220;accounting period ending on the last day on which the &#8230; business was carried on&#8221;. 
These clauses specify instead &#8220;the last accounting period in which the business was 
carried on&#8221;. See Change 82 in Annex 1. 
 
Just and reasonable apportionment 
3137. Clause 1241(2) requires a &#8220;just and reasonable&#8221; apportionment. Section 579(5) 
of ICTA does not specify the basis of apportionment. See Change 12 in Annex 1. 
 
Part of a business 
3138. Clause 1242 applies to payments in connection with the cessation of part of a 
business in the same way as it applies to payments in connection with the cessation of 
a whole business. See Change 17 in Annex 1. 
 
Devolution 
3139. Clause 1243(2)(b) reflects the effect of the devolution settlements. See 
Change 15 in Annex 1. 
 
</ClauseRange><Clause Number="1244" SerialNumber="385">Clause 1244: Contributions to local enterprise organisations or urban 
regeneration companies 
3140. This clause allows deductions for contributions to local enterprise agencies, 
training and enterprise councils, local enterprise companies in Scotland, business links 
and urban regeneration companies. It is based on sections 79, 79A and 79B of ICTA. 
The corresponding rule for trading income is in clause 82. 
 
3141. Subsection (3) is an anti-avoidance rule. It prevents a company using the 
clause to obtain a deduction for non-commercial expenditure, such as funding the 
training of a member of a shareholder&#8217;s family, by passing funds through one of these 
bodies. The source legislation disallows any deduction if there is a benefit to the 
company (or a connected person). This clause merely restricts the deduction by the 
value of the benefit. See Change 18 in Annex 1. 
 
3142. Subsection (6) of this clause invokes the supporting clauses 83 and 86. 
 
3143. If a disqualifying benefit is later received it is charged to tax by clause 1253. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1245" SerialNumber="386">Clause 1245: Payments to Export Credits Guarantee Department 
3144. This clause allows a company to deduct the cost of certain payments to the 
Export Credits Guarantee Department. It is based on section 88 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for trading income is in clause 91. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1246" SerialNumber="387">Clause 1246: Levies under FISMA 2000 
3145. This clause allows a deduction for certain payments arising from FISMA. It is 
based on section 76B of ICTA. The corresponding rule for trading income is in 
clause 92. 
 
3146. A company carrying on investment business may be called upon to make 
payments in connection with FISMA. The payments are of two sorts: 
 
    &#8226; a &#8220;levy&#8221; to meet the running costs of the schemes set up by FISMA; and 
 
    &#8226; &#8220;costs&#8221; which may be awarded at the conclusion of a hearing of a complaint. 
 
3147. Section 76B of ICTA allows as a management expense both sorts of payment. 
But there is a difficulty with one sort of levy. So some changes are made in this clause 
and in the trading income clause to ensure that all the payments under FISMA qualify 
for a deduction. Schedule 1 to this Bill makes a corresponding relaxation in 
section 155 of ITTOIA. See Change 22 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="4" SerialNumber="388">Chapter 4: Rules restricting deductions 
<Clause Number="1247" SerialNumber="389">Clause 1247: Introduction 
3148. This clause introduces the Chapter. It is new. 
 
3149. Subsection (2) lists rules outside this Part that affect the calculation of 
management expenses. All these rules in the source legislation are drafted in wide 
terms (for instance, &#8220;for the purpose of calculating profits or other income charged to 
corporation tax&#8221;). The rules apply to the calculation of management expenses because 
that is part of the calculation of profits charged to corporation tax. 
 
3150. In some cases the application of the rewritten rules is restricted so that they do 
not apply in calculating the profits of a trade or property business. That is because 
there is an equivalent rule in Part 3 (trading income) which is also applied to property 
income by clause 210. 
 
3151. The permissive rules for management expenses in Chapter 3 of this Part say 
that expenses are &#8220;treated for the purposes of Chapter 2 as expenses of management&#8221;. 
The restrictive rules in this Chapter &#8220;restrict the deduction of expenses of 
management under section 1219&#8221; (which is in Chapter 2). So it is clear that the 
restrictive rules have priority. 
 
3152. This is the reverse of the position for trading income, where the general rule in 
clause 51 is that the permissive rules have priority. But, in the unusual cases where it 
is possible for the rules to overlap, the result is the same. 
 
3153. Subsection (3) draws attention to section 196A of FA 2004. This rule about 
pension scheme contributions does not itself restrict management expenses. But it 
gives HMRC power to make regulations that may make such a restriction. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1248" SerialNumber="390">Clause 1248: Expenses in connection with arrangements for securing a tax 
advantage 
3154. This clause disallows expenses incurred in connection with arrangements to 
secure a tax advantage. It is based on section 75 of ICTA. 
 
3155. Subsections (1) and (2) are the basic rule that the expenses are not allowed as 
management expenses. The wording of the subsections echoes that of clause 1220, 
which treats investments held in connection with arrangements to secure a tax 
advantage as held for a disallowable purpose. 
 
3156. Subsection (3) establishes an order of priority for &#8220;disallowable purposes&#8221; 
rules. 
 
    &#8226; If the investments concerned are held for an unallowable purpose, the expenses 
       are not expenses of management of the company&#8217;s investment business 
       (clause 1219(2)(b)). 
 
    &#8226; Otherwise, if a manufactured payment is made in pursuance of arrangements 
       that have an unallowable purpose, relief may be denied for the payment by 
       paragraph 7A of Schedule 23A to ICTA. 
 
    &#8226; If neither of these applies, this clause may apply. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1249" SerialNumber="391">Clause 1249: Unpaid remuneration 
3157. This clause delays a deduction for employees&#8217; (or an office-holder&#8217;s) pay if it 
is paid late. The clause is based on section 44 of FA 1989. The corresponding rule for 
other businesses (based on section 43 of FA 1989) is in clause 1288. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1250" SerialNumber="392">Clause 1250: Unpaid remuneration: supplementary 
3158. This clause provides definitions and further explanation of the main rule in 
clause 1249. It is based on section 44 of FA 1989. The corresponding rule for other 
businesses (based on section 43 of FA 1989) is in clause 1289. 
 
3159. Subsection (1) applies clause 1249 to provisions made in the accounts for 
amounts that may become employees&#8217; remuneration. 
 
3160. Subsection (3) deals with the case in which the company submits its tax return 
before the end of the nine month limit in clause 1249(2) and all or any of the 
remuneration is unpaid. The company must assume the remuneration will remain 
unpaid. If, subsequently, the remuneration is paid within the time limit the calculation 
can be adjusted and the return amended. See Change 68 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1251" SerialNumber="393">Clause 1251: Car or motor cycle hire 
3161. This clause restricts the amount that a company can deduct in respect of the 
cost of hiring certain cars or motor cycles with a retail price (when new) of more than 
&#163;12,000. The clause is based on sections 578A and 578B of ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for trading income is in clause 56. 
 
3162. Under section 75B(3) of ICTA any recovery of the hire charge is restricted to 
the reversal of &#8220;so much of the debit as represents the expenses of management.&#8221; 
Subsection (4) makes this restriction explicit and mirrors the trading income rule in 
clause 56(4). See Change 83 in Annex 1. 
 
3163. Subsection (7) of the clause invokes the supporting clauses 57 and 58. So the 
definition of &#8220;qualifying hire car or motor cycle&#8221; includes a car or motor cycle where 
ownership passes without the exercise of an option to purchase. See the commentary 
on clause 57 and Change 10 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="5" SerialNumber="394">Chapter 5: Companies with investment business: receipts 
<Clause Number="1252" SerialNumber="395">Clause 1252: Industrial development grants 
3164. This clause deals with the treatment of certain grants under the Industrial 
Development Act 1982 or the corresponding provision in Northern Ireland. It is based 
on section 93 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for trading income is in clause 102. 
 
3165. Under section 93(1) of ICTA the payment of a grant is &#8220;taken into account as a 
receipt in computing [the company&#8217;s] profits under Case VI of Schedule D&#8221;. Under 
section 70(1) of ICTA the basis of assessment for Schedule D is the &#8220;profits gains or 
income arising&#8221; in an accounting period. But there is no explicit rule to say into which 
accounting period the grant falls. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1253" SerialNumber="396">Clause 1253: Contributions to local enterprise organisations or urban 
regeneration companies: disqualifying benefits 
3166. This clause sets out what happens if a company (or a connected person) 
receives a benefit in connection with a contribution to a local enterprise organisation 
or urban regeneration company (see clause 1244). It is based on sections 79, 79A 
and 79B of ICTA. The corresponding rule for trading income is in clause 82. 
 
3167. Section 79(9) of ICTA refers to relief having been given &#8220;under subsection (1) 
above&#8221;. Strictly, relief for management expenses is given under subsection (2) by 
reference to a &#8220;deduction under subsection (1)&#8221;. But it is clear in the context of the 
section that the recovery under subsection (9) is intended to apply to management 
expenses as it applies to a trading deduction. The same analysis applies to the 
corresponding provisions in sections 79A and 79B of ICTA. This clause clarifies the 
position. 
 
3168. The charge is restricted to the amount of the &#8220;disqualifying benefit&#8221;. That 
expression is explained in clause 1244(5). See the commentary on that clause and 
Change 18 in Annex 1. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1254" SerialNumber="397">Clause 1254: Repayments under FISMA 2000 
3169. This clause charges tax on a repayment made to a company under FISMA. It is 
based on section 76B of ICTA. The corresponding rule for trading income is in 
clause 92. 
 
3170. Under section 76B(2) of ICTA the repayment is &#8220;charged to tax under Case VI 
of Schedule D&#8221;. Under section 70(1) of ICTA the basis of assessment for Schedule D 
is the &#8220;profits gains or income arising&#8221; in an accounting period. But there is no 
explicit rule to say in which accounting period the repayment falls.

<Clause Number="1255" SerialNumber="399">Clause 1255: Meaning of some accounting terms 
3171. This clause provides definitions of some accounting terms used in this Part. It 
is based on sections 75A and 75B of ICTA. 
 
3172. Subsection (1) deals with the concept of management expenses being &#8220;debited 
in accounts&#8221;. This expression is used in the rules that determine to which accounting 
period expenses are referable. 
 
3173. Subsection (2) deals with the concept of an amount being &#8220;brought into 
account&#8221;. This expression is used in the rule that deals with the claw back of relief. 
There is no reason why the expression should be defined differently in 
sections 75A(10) and 75B(8) of ICTA. So this clause adopts the fuller words of 
section 75A(10). 
 
3174. Subsection (3) removes a small inconsistency between sections 75A(10) 
and 75B(12) of ICTA by referring to a debit that increases or creates a loss.

Overview 
3175. This Part contains the rules that apply to partnerships. The corresponding rules 
for income tax are in Part 9 of ITTOIA. 
 
3176. Section 1 of the Partnership Act 1890 defines partnership as &#8220;the relation 
which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of 
profit&#8221;. Section 4 of the Partnership Act 1890 explains that &#8220;firm&#8221; is the term used for 
the purposes of that Act for persons in partnership. 
 
3177. The clauses in this Bill follow the Partnership Act 1890 and refer to the 
partners collectively as a &#8220;firm&#8221;. But the word &#8220;partnership&#8221; is commonly used as a 
synonym for &#8220;firm&#8221;. So the title of the Part and some of the titles of the clauses use 
the word &#8220;partnerships&#8221;, again following the lead of the Partnership Act 1890. 
 
3178. The rules in this Part determine each partner&#8217;s share of the income of the firm. 
That income share is then charged under the normal rules for the type of income 
concerned. 

 
<Clause Number="1256" SerialNumber="401">Clause 1256: Overview of Part 
3179. This clause introduces this Part of the Bill. It is new. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 846 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1257" SerialNumber="402">Clause 1257: General provisions 
3180. This clause introduces the concept of a &#8220;firm&#8221;. It is new. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 847 of ITTOIA. 
 
3181. The clause drops the references in sections 111 and 114 of ICTA to 
professions. See Change 2 in Annex 1 and the commentary on clause 35. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1258" SerialNumber="403">Clause 1258: Assessment of partnerships 
3182. This clause makes it clear that, for corporation tax purposes, a firm is not an 
entity distinct from the partners in the firm. It is based on section 111 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 848 of ITTOIA. 
 
3183. The clause extends the treatment of trades carried on by firms to businesses 
that are not trades. It is based on section 111(10) of ICTA which was repealed in error 
by ITTOIA. This brings the income tax and corporation tax codes back into line. See 
Change 84 in Annex 1. 
 
3184. In the case of firms established under English law this provision merely 
confirms their position under that law. But Scottish firms, for example, are legal 
entities. This provision ensures that all firms are treated in the same way. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1259" SerialNumber="404">Clause 1259: Calculation of firm&#8217;s profits and losses 
3185. This clause contains the basic rules for calculating the profits of a firm. It is 
based on sections 114 and 115 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 849 of ITTOIA. 
 
3186. Section 6(4) of ICTA extends the meanings of &#8220;profits&#8221; and &#8220;trades&#8221; in 
sections 114 and 115 of ICTA. None of the partnership rules in this Bill applies to 
chargeable gains. So the extension of &#8220;profits&#8221; to include chargeable gains is not 
needed. And for corporation tax purposes a company cannot: 
 
    &#8226; carry on a vocation (see Change 2 in Annex 1); 
 
    &#8226; be employed; or 
 
    &#8226; hold an office in partnership. 
 
3187. So this Bill does not rewrite either extension in section 6(4) of ICTA. 
 
3188. If some of a firm&#8217;s partners are resident in the United Kingdom and some are 
not, the profits of the firm&#8217;s trade must be determined on different bases. For the 
resident partners, the determination includes profits arising outside the United 
Kingdom; for the non-UK resident partners, the determination is restricted to profits 
arising from a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom. (If there are other 
United Kingdom profits, a non-UK resident company is chargeable to income tax on 
those profits and the rules in ITTOIA apply.) 
 
3189. Section 114 of ICTA is not explicit that the profits may have to be determined 
on more than one basis. This clause brings together the rules for resident and non-UK 
resident partners. Subsection (2) introduces the idea that more than one determination 
may be needed. 
 
3190. Subsection (3) sets out the normal basis for determining the profits, for a 
partner resident in the United Kingdom. The profits are determined as if the firm were 
a company resident in the United Kingdom. 
 
3191. Subsection (4) sets out an alternative basis for determining the profits. If the 
company partner is not resident in the United Kingdom the profits of the firm are 
determined as if the firm were a company not resident in the United Kingdom. That 
determination is restricted to the profits arising from a permanent establishment in the 
United Kingdom. So there is no need to rewrite the requirement in section 115(4)(b) 
of ICTA that the partner&#8217;s share of the profits is treated as arising from such a 
permanent establishment. 
 
3192. The profits of the firm are determined by reference to the extent to which they 
would be chargeable to corporation tax. So, in the case of a non-UK resident, the 
profits of which the partner has a share are those attributable to a permanent 
establishment in the United Kingdom. 
 
Changes in partnership 
3193. Section 114(1) of ICTA provides that the business profits of a firm are 
calculated for corporation tax &#8220;as if the partnership were a company&#8221; (referred to in 
this part of the commentary as the &#8220;deemed company&#8221;). This rule applies &#8220;so long as&#8221; 
a company carries on the business in partnership. 
 
3194. The deemed company exists only during the life of the partnership. So a 
company is treated as ceasing to carry on a business when that company takes another 
person into partnership (because the deemed company then carries on the business). 
And the deemed company is treated as ceasing to carry on a business when the 
partnership business is taken over by a company on its own. 
 
3195. Furthermore, the deemed company calculation is made without regard to any 
change in the persons carrying on the business except that a change in the persons is 
treated as a transfer of the business to a different company if there is no company 
which carries on the business before and after the change. 
3196. The occasions on which a company is treated as ceasing to carry on a business 
are set out in the rules to which they are relevant (see clauses 77(5), 80 and 162(3)). 
They also appear in this Part in clauses 1267(3) and (4) and 1271(3). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1260" SerialNumber="405">Clause 1260: Section 1259: supplementary 
3197. This clause sets out the treatment of losses and distributions in the calculation 
of the firm&#8217;s profits under clause 1259. It is based on section 114 of ICTA. 
 
3198. The usual rule is that the profits of the firm are calculated as if the firm were a 
company. On that assumption it is possible that losses brought forward should be 
deducted before the (net) profits are allocated to the partners. Instead, subsection (1) 
makes clear that losses are not taken into account in the calculation of the firm&#8217;s profit 
or loss to be allocated to the partners. 
 
3199. Capital allowances are given as a deduction in calculating profits. So there is 
no need for the rule in section 114(1)(b) and (2) that gives special treatment to capital 
allowances. The same applies to balancing charges, which are treated as business 
receipts. And the rule about charges (also in section 114(1)(b) of ICTA) is not needed 
because charges cannot be a deduction in calculating the profits of a trade. 
 
3200. There is a closely related rule in section 116(5) of ICTA. It is that, for the 
purposes of that section, capital allowances and charges are taken into account. As 
there is no longer a partnership rule that allowances and charges are ignored, there is 
no need for section 116(5) of ICTA. So it is repealed by Schedule 1 to this Bill. 
 
3201. Schedule 1 to the Bill introduces a new subsection (4) to section 849 of 
ITTOA to make clear similarly that losses brought forward are ignored in calculating 
the firm&#8217;s profits for income tax purposes. 
 
3202. Subsection (2) is based on section 114(1)(a) of ICTA, which provides that 
&#8220;references to distributions shall not apply&#8221;. It is clear from the context that this rule 
applies to payments made by the firm. So there is no question of a payment of, say, 
interest being treated as a distribution by the firm under section 209 of ICTA and 
being disallowed in calculating the firm&#8217;s profit. See Schedule 1 and Change 85 in 
Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1261" SerialNumber="406">Clause 1261: Accounting periods of firms 
3203. This clause sets out how accounting periods of a firm are determined. It is 
based on section 114 of ICTA. The concept of an accounting period of a firm is used 
in clause 1259 for the calculation of the firm&#8217;s profit or loss. 
 
3204. An accounting period of a firm begins when the rule in section 114(1) of 
ICTA first applies. That is, when a company first carries on the trade etc in 
partnership. That circumstance is set out in subsections (2)(b) and (3) of the clause. 
3205. An accounting period of a firm ends when the rule in section 114(1) of ICTA 
no longer applies. That is, when the last company leaves a firm, or (if the company 
continues to carry on the trade etc) when the company is no longer in partnership. 
That circumstance is set out in subsections (2)(c) and (4) of the clause. 
 
3206. An accounting period of a firm ends when there is a change in the persons 
carrying on the trade etc and the change is treated by 114(1)(c) of ICTA as the 
transfer of the trade etc to a different company. That is, when there is no &#8220;corporate 
continuity&#8221; between the members of the firm before and after the change. That 
circumstance is set out in subsections (2)(d) and (5) of the clause. 
 
3207. The usual rules about an accounting period ending on a date to which the firm 
makes up accounts and about an accounting period ending on the expiration of 12 
months apply without being specifically mentioned in this clause. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1262" SerialNumber="407">Clause 1262: Allocation of firm&#8217;s profits or losses between partners 
3208. This clause is the link between the firm&#8217;s profit or loss and the amounts 
assessable on the partners. It is based on section 114 of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 850 of ITTOIA. 
 
3209. The basic rule in this clause applies in most cases. But, if the basic rule 
produces a loss for a partner when the firm&#8217;s result is a profit, the allocation is 
adjusted under clause 1263. Similarly, if the basic rule produces a profit for a partner 
when the firm&#8217;s result is a loss, the allocation is adjusted under clause 1264. 
 
3210. In a firm where some partners are liable to income tax and others liable to 
corporation tax, the rules requiring an adjusted allocation are not straightforward. In 
this Bill they are set out in two separate clauses. The Bill amends ITTOIA to set out 
the income tax rules in the same way (in new sections 850A and 850B of ITTOIA) &#8211; 
see Schedule 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1263" SerialNumber="408">Clause 1263: Profit-making period in which some partners have losses 
3211. This clause sets out what happens if the calculation of a partner&#8217;s share of the 
firm&#8217;s profit or loss under clause 1262 produces a loss, even though the overall result 
for the firm is a profit. It is new. The corresponding rule for income tax was in 
section 850 of ITTOIA but is now in the new section 850A of ITTOIA. 
 
3212. The clause is most likely to apply when one or more partners are entitled to a 
salary or interest on the firm&#8217;s capital. A partner&#8217;s &#8220;loss&#8221; determined under 
clause 1262 is, in effect, reallocated to the other partners, to reduce their shares of the 
profit. See Change 86 in Annex 1. 
 
3213. Subsection (2) sets out the position for company A if it has a profit but any of 
the other partners has a loss determined under clause 1262. The rule is that company 
A&#8217;s profit is reduced so that the total of the shares of the profit-making partners is no 
more than the amount of the firm&#8217;s profits. 
3214. If some of the members of the firm are UK resident and some are non-UK 
resident (see clause 1259), the measure of the firm&#8217;s profit may vary, depending on 
the residence of the partner &#8220;in relation to&#8221; which the firm&#8217;s profit is calculated. 
Similarly, if any of the partners is chargeable to income tax, that partner&#8217;s share is 
determined under ITTOIA and not under clause 1262. 
 
3215. So subsection (2) refers to &#8220;the comparable amount&#8221; for a partner. This 
amount may be on a basis different from that appropriate for that partner under 
clause 1259 or the corresponding ITTOIA rule. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1264" SerialNumber="409">Clause 1264: Loss-making period in which some partners have profits 
3216. This clause sets out what happens if the calculation of a partner&#8217;s share of the 
firm&#8217;s profit or loss under clause 1262 produces a profit, even though the overall 
result for the firm is a loss. It is new. The corresponding rule for income tax was in 
section 850 of ITTOIA but is now in the new section 850B of ITTOIA. 
 
3217. The clause is the mirror-image of clause 1263. It is most likely to apply when 
one or more partners are entitled to a salary or interest on the firm&#8217;s capital. A 
partner&#8217;s &#8220;profit&#8221; determined under clause 1262 is, in effect, reallocated to the other 
partners, to reduce their shares of the loss. See Change 86 in Annex 1. 
 
3218. Subsection (2) sets out the position for company A if it has a loss but any of 
the other partners has a profit determined under clause 1262. The rule is that company 
A&#8217;s loss is reduced so that the total of the shares of the loss-making partners is no 
more than the amount of the firm&#8217;s losses. 
 
3219. If some of the members of the firm are UK resident and some are non-UK 
resident (see clause 1259), the measure of the firm&#8217;s loss may vary, depending on the 
residence of the partner &#8220;in relation to&#8221; which the firm&#8217;s loss is calculated. Similarly, 
if any of the partners is chargeable to income tax, that partner&#8217;s share is determined 
under ITTOIA and not under clause 1262. 
 
3220. So subsection (2) refers to &#8220;the comparable amount&#8221; for a partner. This 
amount may be on a basis different from that appropriate for that partner under 
clause 1259 or the corresponding ITTOIA rule. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1265" SerialNumber="410">Clause 1265: Apportionment of profit share between partner&#8217;s accounting 
periods 
3221. This clause allocates a partner&#8217;s share of the firm&#8217;s profit or loss to accounting 
periods of the partner. It is based on section 114 of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1266" SerialNumber="411">Clause 1266: Resident partners and double taxation agreements 
3222. This clause ensures that a UK resident company partner&#8217;s share of the income 
of a foreign firm remains liable to United Kingdom corporation tax even though the 
income of the firm as a whole is exempt from United Kingdom corporation tax in 
accordance with a double taxation agreement. It is based on section 115 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 858 of ITTOIA. 
 
3223. The business profits article of the United Kingdom/Jersey double taxation 
arrangement exempts the profits of a Jersey firm from United Kingdom tax. In the 
case of Padmore v CIR (1989), 62 TC 352 CA 1, the Court of Appeal decided that the 
exemption extended to the share of the profits arising to a United Kingdom resident 
individual. The rules in section 115(5) to (5B) of ICTA were enacted to remove the 
exemption. 
 
3224. Subsection (1) sets out the type of company and firm with which the clause is 
concerned. It goes on to identify the sort of exemption from tax that was considered in 
the Padmore case. 
 
3225. For United Kingdom tax purposes, if it is necessary to consider where a firm is 
resident, the question is likely to be decided by the place where the firm&#8217;s business is 
controlled and managed. But it is possible that, under foreign law, a firm may be 
considered to be resident elsewhere, for example, by reference to where the firm was 
established. So the clause uses both the &#8220;control and management&#8221; test and the 
&#8220;resides&#8221; test. 
 
3226. Subsection (2) makes it clear that the clause does no more than remove any 
exemption under a double taxation arrangement. It does not deny other reliefs, such as 
tax credit relief. See Change 87 in Annex 1. 
 
3227. Subsection (3) deals with United Kingdom tax credits, which may be relevant 
to the calculation of a company&#8217;s &#8220;shadow ACT&#8221; (see SI 1999/358, made under 
section 32 of FA 1998). A double taxation arrangement may give a non-UK resident 
&#8220;person&#8221; an entitlement to payment of a tax credit on a distribution by a United 
Kingdom company. This subsection makes it clear that, where that &#8220;person&#8221; is a firm, 
only a UK resident partner has the entitlement. 
 
3228. Section 115(5A) of ICTA applies also to capital gains. That part of the rule is 
not rewritten in this Bill. It is moved to TCGA by an amendment to section 59 of 
TCGA (see Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Bill). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1267" SerialNumber="412">Clause 1267: Various rules for trades and property businesses 
3229. This clause clarifies the position of firms that are affected by the rules in 
Chapter 14 of Part 3 or clause 262 of the Bill. It is based on paragraph 13 of 
Schedule 22 to FA 2002 (as applied to property businesses by section 21B of ICTA). 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 860 of ITTOIA. 
 
    STC [1989] 493 
3230. The clause differs from its income tax equivalent because a positive 
adjustment on a change of basis is dealt with differently for income tax and 
corporation tax. For income tax, such an adjustment is the subject of a separate 
charge, in section 228 or 330 of ITTOIA. For corporation tax, the adjustment is 
treated as a trade or property business receipt and so is charged to tax under clause 35 
or 209. 
 
3231. This clause explicitly applies to property businesses. In ITTOIA the position is 
different because the extension to non-trade businesses in section 847 of ITTOIA does 
not apply to section 860. But section 860 of ITTOIA does apply to property 
businesses as a result of section 272(1) of ITTOIA, because the restriction in 
section 272(2) does not exclude rules outside Part 2 such as those in Chapter 7 of 
Part 3 of ITTOIA. Schedule 1 to the Bill amends section 860 of ITTOIA to clarify the 
income tax position, with a minor related amendment to section 847 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1268" SerialNumber="413">Clause 1268: Election for spreading under Chapter 14 of Part 3 
3232. This clause sets out two rules for firms that make an election under clause 186. 
It is based on section 114 of ICTA and paragraphs 9 and 13 of Schedule 22 to 
FA 2002. The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 860 of ITTOIA. 
 
3233. Subsection (1) ensures that the adjustment charge is not &#8220;rolled up&#8221; under 
clause 186 just because a company leaves or joins the firm. 
 
3234. Subsection (2) is the rule about making an election under clause 186. The 
&#8220;date on which the new basis was adopted&#8221; is defined in clause 1269. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1269" SerialNumber="414">Clause 1269: Interpretation of clauses 1267 and 1268 
3235. This clause explains expressions used in the two preceding clauses. It is based 
on paragraph 13 of Schedule 22 to FA 2002. The corresponding rule for income tax is 
in section 860(6) of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1270" SerialNumber="415">Clause 1270: Special provisions about farming and property income 
3236. This clause clarifies the position of firms that carry on a farming trade or 
property business. It is based on sections 15, 53 and 70A of ICTA. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 859 of ITTOIA. 
 
3237. In section 53(2) of ICTA there is a rule that all farming carried on in the 
United Kingdom by a company is a single trade. The section refers to a &#8220;particular 
company or partnership&#8221;. 
 
3238. In section 15 of ICTA there is a similar rule that all property income activity 
carried on by a person forms a single property business. Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule A 
refers to a &#8220;particular person or partnership&#8221;. Section 70A(4) of ICTA, which deals 
with overseas property businesses, refers to a &#8220;particular company or partnership&#8221;. 
3239. Subsection (1) is the rule that all farming carried on by a firm is a single trade. 
The subsection also makes it clear that the firm&#8217;s single farming trade does not 
include any farming trade carried on by a company separately from the firm. 
 
3240. Subsections (2) and (3) are the corresponding rules for UK property businesses 
and overseas property businesses. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1271" SerialNumber="416">Clause 1271: Sale of patent rights: effect of partnership changes 
3241. This clause sets out what happens when there is a sale of patent rights by a 
trader and there is change in the membership of any firm that carries on the trade. It is 
based on section 558 of CAA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 861 
of ITTOIA. 
 
3242. The rules for intellectual property are split: 
 
    &#8226; the rules that give capital allowances are in CAA; 
 
    &#8226; the rules that charge capital receipts from the sale of patent rights are in 
       Chapter 3 of Part 9; and 
 
    &#8226; the special rules that apply to firms are set out in this clause and clause 1272. 
 
3243. If a trader receives a sum from the sale of patent rights in the ordinary course 
of the trade the sum is a trade receipt. In that case, it is not a &#8220;capital sum&#8221; and 
clause 913(1)(a) of this Bill ensures that the special rules do not apply. 
 
3244. If a trader receives a capital sum from the sale of patent rights, the sum is 
excluded from the calculation of the trade profits by the general rule that excludes 
capital receipts. Instead, the sum is separately charged to corporation tax under 
Chapter 3 of Part 9 of this Bill. The profit on the sale is charged to tax over six years. 
But the seller may elect to have the sum charged in the year in which the proceeds of 
sale are received. Or the charge may be spread in accordance with clause 916 or 917 
of this Bill. 
 
3245. In the case of a taxpayer liable to corporation tax, Part 8 of this Bill sets out 
rules for the taxation of gains and losses on companies&#8217; intangible fixed assets. Those 
rules take priority over any other tax rules (see clause 906(1)). So the Part 8 rules 
generally apply instead of the rule in this clause. But Chapter 16 of Part 8 ensures that 
the Part 8 rules apply only to assets created or acquired on or after 1 April 2002. 
 
3246. Subsection (1) sets out the conditions for the clause to apply. In particular, 
there has to be: 
 
    &#8226; a charge (to income tax or corporation tax) on the proceeds from the sale of 
       patent rights; and 
    &#8226; a change in the persons carrying on the trade during periods in which tax is 
       chargeable. 
 
3247. Subsection (4) determines the amount to be charged as income of each 
company in the period of change. That amount is in two parts: 
 
    &#8226; for the period up to the change, a time-apportioned part of the amount that 
       would otherwise have been charged for the whole period; and 
 
    &#8226; for the period after the change, the company&#8217;s share of the amount still to be 
       charged after the change, apportioned to the period on a time basis. 
 
3248. Subsection (5) sets out the general assumption that all the current partners step 
into the shoes of the persons who were partners at the time of the original sale. The 
amount charged in each accounting period is arrived at by spreading the remaining 
charge evenly over the rest of the period for which tax would otherwise have been 
charged. 
 
3249. One of the consequences of the current partners stepping into the shoes of the 
original partners is that an amount originally charged to income tax may become 
charged to corporation tax, and vice versa. This consequence was not explicitly 
acknowledged in ITTOIA. So Part 2 of Schedule 1 to this Bill amends sections 861 
and 862 of ITTOIA to clarify how the rule works for income tax. See Change 89 in 
Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1272" SerialNumber="417">Clause 1272: Sale of patent rights: effect of later cessation of trade 
3250. This clause sets out what happens when there has been a sale of patent rights 
to which the previous clause applied and the last corporate partner leaves the firm. It 
is based on section 525 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 862 of ITTOIA. See also paragraph 3245 of this commentary about the effect 
of Part 8 of this Bill and Change 89 in Annex 1. 
 
3251. Subsection (2) sets out how the &#8220;rolled-up&#8221; charge is split between the current 
partners on cessation of the trade. As in section 525(4) of ICTA, the charge is made 
on the persons who are partners immediately before the cessation. Otherwise, the 
charge would be allocated by reference to the profit-sharing arrangements in the 
whole of the final accounting period. Schedule 1 to this Bill amends section 862 of 
ITTOIA to clarify how the rule works for income tax. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1273" SerialNumber="418">Clause 1273: Limited liability partnerships 
3252. This clause contains the rules that treat limited liability partnerships (&#8220;LLPs&#8221;) 
in the same way for tax purposes as ordinary partnerships (&#8220;firms&#8221; in this Bill). It is 
based on section 118ZA of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 863 of ITTOIA. 
3253. Subsection (1)(a) ascribes the activities of the LLP to its members. 
Subsection (1) does not refer to an LLP carrying on a profession. See Change 2 in 
Annex 1.

3254. This Part provides relief from corporation tax if income arising in a territory 
outside the United Kingdom cannot be remitted to the United Kingdom. It also 
provides for withdrawal of relief if such income ceases to be unremittable. And it 
explains how unremittable income is to be valued if relief is not in fact claimed. The 
Part is based on section 584 of ICTA. The corresponding rules for income tax are in 
Chapter 4 of Part 8 of ITTOIA. 
 
3255. This Part applies to &#8220;income arising in a territory outside the United 
Kingdom&#8221;. In the source legislation for this Bill, income arising outside the United 
Kingdom is charged to corporation tax mainly under Schedule D Case V (section 18 
of ICTA). But some foreign income is charged under Schedule D Case VI (in 
circumstances that that Case is applied by a provision other than section 18 of ICTA), 
or under a non-schedular provision, if the provision covers income arising outside the 
United Kingdom. 
 
3256. Profits made by the foreign branch of a United Kingdom trade are charged in 
Part 3. Such profits are not income arising in a territory outside the United Kingdom 
and this Part does not apply. (But Chapter 12 of Part 3 (deductions from profits: 
unremittable amounts) provides an equivalent relief in relation to a United Kingdom 
trade.) 
 
3257. The paragraph headed &#8220;unremittable income that arose in an accounting period 
ending before 1 April 2009&#8221; in Part 21 of Schedule 2 to this Bill (transitionals and 
savings), the equivalent for corporation tax purposes of paragraph 153(1) and (2) of 
Schedule 2 to ITTOIA, ensures that this Part applies for an accounting period ending 
on or after 1 April 2009 even though the income in question arose in an accounting 
period ending before that date. 
 
3258. This Part does not rewrite the appeal jurisdiction rules in section 584(9) of 
ICTA. See Change 98 in Annex 1. (But sub-paragraph (7) of the paragraph headed 
&#8220;tribunal reform&#8221; in Part 21 of Schedule 2 to this Bill, the equivalent for corporation 
tax purposes of paragraph 153(3) and (4) of Schedule 2 to ITTOIA, preserves the 
effect of section 584(9) of ICTA in the circumstances set out in the first-mentioned 
paragraph if the appeal involves income that arose in an accounting period ending 
before 1 April 2009.) 
 
<Clause Number="1274" SerialNumber="420">Clause 1274: Unremittable income: introduction 
3259. This clause defines unremittable income and sets out the circumstances in 
which this Part applies. It is based on section 584(1) of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 841 of ITTOIA. 
3260. The source legislation refers to &#8220;foreign currency&#8221;. This means a currency 
other than the currency of the territory in question. Since the local currency must be 
obtainable, it is superfluous to add that currency not obtainable is &#8216;foreign&#8217;. 
 
3261. Condition A for unremittable income refers to the impossibility of obtaining 
currency in the territory in question and makes explicit that this means currency that 
could be transferred to the United Kingdom (whether the currency of that or another 
territory). See Change 90 in Annex 1. 
 
3262. The requirement in the source legislation, that the inability to transfer the 
income to the United Kingdom is not due to any want of reasonable endeavours on the 
part of the claimant, is omitted. See again Change 90 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1275" SerialNumber="421">Clause 1275: Claim for relief for unremittable income 
3263. This clause deals with claims for relief and sets out how the relief applies. It is 
based on section 584(1), (2),(5) and (6) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income 
tax is in section 842 of ITTOIA. 
 
3264. The effect of subsection (1) is that the unremittable income is omitted from the 
company&#8217;s taxable income for the accounting period in which it arises. 
 
3265. Subsection (4) defines an Export Credits Guarantee Department payment 
(&#8220;ECGD payment&#8221;). The statutory references in the source legislation have been 
updated. As section 13(1) of the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991 
delegates the functions of the Secretary of State under section 2 of that Act to the 
Export Credits Guarantee Department, the clause refers to the role of that Department 
(rather than the Secretary of State) in administering this scheme. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1276" SerialNumber="422">Clause 1276: Withdrawal of relief 
3266. This clause brings together the consequences both of unremittable income 
becoming remittable and of a payment being made by the Export Credits Guarantee 
Department. It is based on section 584(2A) and (5) of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 843 of ITTOIA. 
 
3267. Subsections (3) and (5) set out when, and at what value, income ceasing to be 
unremittable is treated as arising. Income so treated as arising is charged under the 
provision appropriate to the income type (or types) that would have applied to the 
income when it arose but for the relief. 
 
3268. Subsection (4) provides that, when an ECGD payment is made, income is 
treated as arising at that time to the extent of the payment. This reflects the intention 
of the legislation as originally drafted. Amendments made by FA 1996 obscured the 
point. See Change 91 in Annex 1. Subsection (5) deals with the value of that income. 
3269. Subsection (6) prevents a double charge under this clause. For example, if 
relief has already been withdrawn because an ECGD payment has been received, 
there is no further charge &#8211; to the extent of that payment &#8211; if the income itself 
subsequently becomes remittable. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1277" SerialNumber="423">Clause 1277: Income charged on withdrawal of relief after source ceases 
3270. This clause sets out how relief given under this Part is withdrawn when 
income ceases to be unremittable after the source of the income has ceased. It is based 
on section 584(4) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 844 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
3271. If relief cannot be withdrawn in accordance with clause 1276, because the 
trade or property business in question has permanently ceased, the amount in respect 
of which relief is withdrawn is dealt with as a post-cessation receipt under Chapter 15 
of Part 3 (trading income) or Chapter 9 of Part 4 (property income) of this Bill. In 
both cases, the provision in the relevant Chapter limiting its application is disapplied 
as unnecessary. 
 
3272. For any other case where relief is withdrawn after the source has ceased, 
subsection (4) provides that the income should be taxed as if the source had not 
ceased. See Change 19 in Annex 1. 
 
3273. Income charged by virtue of this clause is, in the source legislation, charged 
under Schedule D Case VI (rather than Schedule D Case V or another charge). The 
potential relevance of such income to relief under section 396 of ICTA (losses from 
miscellaneous transactions) is preserved by consequential amendments in Schedule 1 
to this Bill, which amend that section and insert section 834A of ICTA. See the 
commentary on Schedule 1 for the insertion of section 834A of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1278" SerialNumber="424">Clause 1278: Valuing unremittable income 
3274. This clause sets out how unremittable income is valued if relief under this Part 
is not claimed. It is based on section 584(8) of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 845 of ITTOIA. 
 
3275. The clause applies if no claim is made under clause 1275 for relief under this 
Part. In such a case, the charge to tax is not deferred. So the income is charged to 
corporation tax in the accounting period to which it refers. This clause determines the 
sterling value of the amount to be charged. 
 
</Clause></Part><Part Number="19" SerialNumber="425">Part 19: General exemptions 
Overview 
3276. This Part groups all of the clauses which provide exemption for income 
otherwise charged to corporation tax by this Bill. The exemptions, where relevant, 
apply to both United Kingdom and foreign income unless one of these kinds of 
income is expressly excluded in the clause. 

 
<Clause Number="1279" SerialNumber="426">Clause 1279: Exemption of profits from securities free of tax to residents abroad 
(&#8220;FOTRA securities&#8221;) 
3277. This clause exempts FOTRA securities specified in clause 1280(1) from 
corporation tax and sets out the two conditions that must be met if that exemption is to 
apply. It is based on section 154 of FA 1996. The corresponding rule for income tax is 
in section 714 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1280" SerialNumber="427">Clause 1280: Section 1279: supplementary provision 
3278. This clause sets out the three different classes of United Kingdom Government 
securities exempt in the hands of non-UK residents (FOTRA securities) and defines 
the term &#8220;the exemption condition&#8221; and &#8220;gilt-edged security&#8221; used in this clause. It is 
based on section 154(8) of FA 1996 and section 161 of FA 1998. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 713 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1281" SerialNumber="428">Clause 1281: Income from savings certificates 
3279. This clause provides an exemption for income from savings certificates where 
the holding is within specified limits. It is based on section 46(1), (3), (4) and (6) of 
ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 692 of ITTOIA. 
 
3280. The source legislation refers to the limits in terms of purchase by, or on behalf 
of, a person. Subsection (2) rewrites this as &#8220;acquisition&#8221; to avoid confusion for 
situations such as joint ownership where special regulations apply. It also refers to the 
regulations as limiting a person&#8217;s holding in line with the way the regulations are 
written. 
 
3281. Subsection (2) introduces the words &#8220;so far as&#8221;. This allows exemption to be 
conferred in part in respect of multiple savings certificates. See Change 92 in 
Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1282" SerialNumber="429">Clause 1282: Income from Ulster Savings Certificates 
3282. This clause provides an exemption for income from Ulster Savings 
Certificates for holdings within specified limits. It is based on section 46 of ICTA, 
which also deals with savings certificates generally (see clause 1281). The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 693 of ITTOIA. 
 
3283. Although Ulster Savings Certificates have not been issued since March 1997, 
there are still holdings which have not been redeemed. Consequently it is necessary to 
rewrite this provision to ensure that interest continuing to be paid in respect of these 
holdings is exempt from corporation tax. 
 
3284. Subsection (4) introduces the words &#8220;so far as&#8221;. This allows exemption to be 
conferred in part in respect of multiple savings certificates. See Change 92 in 
Annex 1. 
 
3285. Subsection (4) uses &#8220;acquisition&#8221; rather than purchase and refers to a person&#8217;s 
holding in line with the way the regulations are written. 
3286. Subsection (5) does not specify that the claim for exemption is to be made to 
the Board. Where a notice to deliver a corporation tax return has been issued, 
paragraphs 57 and 58 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 require the claim to be made in the 
return or by amendment of the return if possible. See Change 1 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1283" SerialNumber="430">Clause 1283: Interest from tax reserve certificates 
3287. This clause exempts interest on tax reserve certificates from corporation tax. It 
is based on section 46(2) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1284" SerialNumber="431">Clause 1284: Housing grants 
3288. This clause exempts from corporation tax grants paid under legislation 
intended to assist in providing, maintaining or improving housing. It is based on 
section 578 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 769 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
3289. Subsection (1) reflects the effect of the devolution settlements. See Change 15 
in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1285" SerialNumber="432">Clause 1285: UK company distributions 
3290. This clause sets out the exemption from the charge to corporation tax on 
dividends and other distributions made by a UK resident company. It is based on 
section 208 of ICTA. 
 
3291. The judgement in the case of Strand Options and Futures Ltd v Vojak, 76 
TC 220 CA 2, provides judicial interpretation of section 208 of ICTA. The Court of 
Appeal held that the exemption referred specifically to leaving dividends and other 
distributions out of account in computing income, which does not mean that the 
amount of a distribution should be left out of account in computing a chargeable gain. 
 
3292. Subsection (2) encapsulates the court&#8217;s interpretation of the legislation in 
respect of distributions and their inclusion in a chargeable gains computation. 
 
3293. Section 337A(1)(a) of ICTA, rewritten as clause 1305, denies a deduction in 
computing profits for corporation tax purposes in respect of dividends and other 
distributions. The wording of section 208 of ICTA makes no distinction between 
receipts and deductions in computing income, and it therefore potentially overlaps 
with section 337A(1)(a) of ICTA. The words &#8220;as receipts&#8221; have therefore been added 
to this clause to clarify its role. 
 
3294. The clause also provides signposts to certain exceptions to the general rule.

</Clause><Clause Number="1286" SerialNumber="433">Clause 1286: VAT repayment supplements 
3295. This clause exempts VAT repayment supplement from corporation tax. It is 
based on section 827 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in 
section 777 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1287" SerialNumber="434">Clause 1287: Incentives to use electronic communications 
3296. This clause exempts from corporation tax incentives provided under 
regulations for the use of electronic communications. It is based on section 143 of 
FA 2000. The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 778 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause></Part><Part Number="20" SerialNumber="435">Part 20: General calculation rules 
Overview 
3297. This Part contains a number of generally applicable rules. They apply to all 
income charged to corporation tax. 
 
3298. The rules are included here to save repetition at numerous points in the Bill. 
Some of the rules apply mainly to trading and property income within Parts 3 and 4 of 
this Bill. The approach for income tax in ITTOIA is to put one version of the rule in 
the trading income Part, with another version of the rule in the general provisions 
Part. But for corporation tax the rules apply also to expenses of management (see 
Part 16 of this Bill) and expenses of insurance companies (see section 76 of ICTA). 
 
<Chapter Number="1" SerialNumber="436">Chapter 1: Restriction of deductions 
<Clause Number="1288" SerialNumber="437">Clause 1288: Unpaid remuneration 
3299. This clause defers a deduction for employees&#8217; (or an office-holder&#8217;s) 
remuneration in a period of account if that remuneration remains unpaid nine months 
after the period has ended. It is based on section 43 of FA 1989. The corresponding 
rule for income tax is in section 36 of ITTOIA. 
 
3300. Section 43 of FA 1989 was introduced when the assessment of employment 
income was put on a receipts basis. A deduction for employees&#8217; pay may be linked to 
the time when the pay is received by the employees. 
 
3301. This clause uses &#8220;income from any source&#8221; rather than &#8220;profits or gains&#8221;, to 
define the scope of the rule. See the commentary on the omission of &#8220;gains&#8221; in the 
overview of Part 3 of this Bill. There is a separate rule for expenses of management in 
clause 1249. 
 
3302. Schedule 2 to this Bill preserves the commencement rule for the amendment 
of the source legislation by Schedule 24 to FA 2003. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1289" SerialNumber="438">Clause 1289: Unpaid remuneration: supplementary 
3303. This clause provides definitions and further explanation of the main rule in 
clause 1288. It is based on section 43 of FA 1989. The corresponding rule for income 
tax is in section 37 of ITTOIA. 
3304. Subsection (1) applies clause 1288 to provisions made in the accounts for 
amounts that may become employees&#8217; remuneration. 
 
3305. Subsection (3) deals with the case in which the company submits its tax return 
before the end of the nine month limit in clause 1288(2) and all or any of the 
remuneration is unpaid. The company must assume the remuneration will remain 
unpaid. If, subsequently, the remuneration is paid within the time limit the calculation 
can be adjusted and the return amended. See Change 68 in Annex 1. 
 
Employee benefit contributions 
Overview 
3306. The next eight clauses deal with the deduction allowed in respect of an 
employer&#8217;s contribution to an employee benefit scheme. They are based on 
Schedule 24 to FA 2003. The corresponding rules for income tax are in sections 38 
to 44 of ITTOIA. 
 
3307. The clauses give a comprehensive set of rules for determining when 
deductions can be made for payments made by an employer to a third party to hold or 
use to provide benefits for the employer&#8217;s employees. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1290" SerialNumber="439">Clause 1290: Employee benefit contributions 
3308. This clause sets out the conditions under which a deduction may be allowed. It 
is based on paragraphs 1 and 8 of Schedule 24 to FA 2003. The corresponding rules 
for income tax are in section 38 of ITTOIA. 
 
3309. The legislation rewritten in this clause does not apply to deductions that would 
otherwise be allowed for periods ending before 27 November 2002, or in respect of 
employee benefit contributions made before that date. This limitation is preserved in 
Schedule 2 (transitionals and savings). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1291" SerialNumber="440">Clause 1291: Making of &#8220;employee benefit contributions&#8221; 
3310. This clause defines the transactional characteristics which must be present if a 
payment is to qualify for relief as an &#8220;employee benefit contribution&#8221;. It is based on 
paragraphs 1 and 9 of Schedule 24 to FA 2003. The corresponding rule for income tax 
is in section 39 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1292" SerialNumber="441">Clause 1292: Provision of qualifying benefits 
3311. This clause sets out what is meant by the provision of qualifying benefits. It is 
based on paragraph 2 of Schedule 24 to FA 2003. The corresponding rules for income 
tax are in section 40 of ITTOIA. 
</Clause><Clause Number="1293" SerialNumber="442">Clause 1293: Timing and amount of certain qualifying benefits 
3312. This clause sets out: 
 
    &#8226; when benefits in the form of money are treated as provided; and 
 
    &#8226; how to calculate the value of benefits provided by the transfer of an asset. 
 
3313. It is based on paragraphs 2 and 5 of Schedule 24 to FA 2003. The 
corresponding rules for income tax are in section 41 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1294" SerialNumber="443">Clause 1294: Provision or payment out of employee benefit contributions 
3314. This clause sets out the rules for allocating the provision of qualifying 
benefits, or payment of qualifying expenses, by the third party against the employee 
benefit contributions received. It is based on paragraph 4 of Schedule 24 to FA 2003. 
The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 42 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1295" SerialNumber="444">Clause 1295: Profits calculated before end of 9 month period 
3315. This clause applies if the company makes its corporation tax return before the 
end of the nine month period. It is based on paragraph 6 of Schedule 24 to FA 2003. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 43 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1296" SerialNumber="445">Clause 1296: Interpretation of sections 1290 to 1296 
3316. This clause interprets and defines terms. It is based on paragraphs 3 and 9 of 
Schedule 24 to FA 2003. The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 44 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1297" SerialNumber="446">Clause 1297: Life assurance business 
3317. This clause modifies the operation of clause 1290 where the company in 
question is charged on the I minus E basis in respect of life assurance business and 
claims a deduction for expenses under section 76 of ICTA. It is based on paragraph 7 
of Schedule 24 to FA 2003. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1298" SerialNumber="447">Clause 1298: Business entertainment and gifts 
3318. This clause and the following two clauses deal with expenditure on business 
entertainment or gifts. It is based on section 577 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in sections 45 and 867 of ITTOIA. 
 
3319. Section 577 of ICTA denies a deduction for certain expenses &#8220;in computing 
profits chargeable to corporation tax under Schedule D&#8221;. Profits chargeable to 
corporation tax under Schedule D include profits of a business which is neither a trade 
nor a property business. And section 577(7)(b) of ICTA indicates that references to a 
trade, for the purposes of the section, include references to a business. 
 
3320. The exceptions to the general rules are not limited to trades. See Change 93 in 
Annex 1. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1299" SerialNumber="448">Clause 1299: Business entertainment: exceptions 
3321. This clause provides exceptions to the prohibition in clause 1298 relating to 
business entertainment in certain circumstances. It is based on section 577 of ICTA. 
The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 46 of ITTOIA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1300" SerialNumber="449">Clause 1300: Business gifts: exceptions 
3322. This clause provides exceptions to the prohibition in clause 1298 relating to 
business gifts in certain circumstances. It is based on section 577 of ICTA. The 
corresponding rules for income tax are in section 47 of ITTOIA. 
 
3323. Subsection (3) allows the Treasury to increase the monetary limit in 
paragraph (b). See Change 94 in Annex 1. 
 
3324. Subsection (5) makes an exception for gifts to charities and named bodies. 
Section 577(9) of ICTA limits this exception to the computation of profits under 
Schedule D Cases I and II, that is, to income calculated under rules rewritten in Part 3 
of this Bill. It was not intended that the exception should be applied narrowly to the 
disadvantage of a business other than a trade or property business. This section 
extends the exception to such businesses. See Change 93 in Annex 1. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1301" SerialNumber="450">Clause 1301: Restriction of deductions for annual payments 
3325. This clause prevents annual payments for which the consideration is either a 
dividend or not taxable from being deducted in calculating a company&#8217;s income from 
any source. It is based on section 125 of ICTA. The corresponding income tax rule is 
in sections 843 and 904 of ITA. 
 
3326. Subsections (4) to (6) together set out the conditions that must be met by an 
annual payment in order for the rule in subsection (1) to apply to the payment. 
 
3327. The source legislation specifies that the payment must not be interest 
(section 125(2)(a) of ICTA). Annual payments within subsection (2) do not include 
interest, so this does not need to be stated explicitly. In addition, no specific reference 
is made to annuities (also mentioned in the source legislation) as these are simply one 
type of annual payment. 
 
3328. This clause does not rewrite the exclusion in section 125(3)(a) of ICTA for 
payments which in the hands of the recipient are income falling within 
section 627(2)(a) of ITTOIA. Such payments cannot be relevant for corporation tax 
purposes since such payments can only be made by an individual. Nor does this clause 
rewrite the commencement provision in section 125(5) of ICTA, which is spent. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1302" SerialNumber="451">Clause 1302: Social security contributions 
3329. This clause prevents a deduction for most social security contributions for any 
corporation tax purpose. It is based on section 617 of ICTA. The corresponding rule 
for income tax is in section 868 of ITTOIA. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1303" SerialNumber="452">Clause 1303: Penalties, interest and VAT surcharges 
3330. This clause contains the general rule that tax penalties and interest are not to 
be deducted. It is based on section 827 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income 
tax is in section 869 of ITTOIA. 
 
3331. This clause refers to &#8220;profits&#8221; because the rule covers both the calculation of 
income and deductions (such as expenses of management within Part 16) from total 
profits. 
 
3332. Section 90(1)(b) of TMA prohibits a deduction for interest payable &#8220;under this 
Part&#8221; of TMA. Section 90(2) cancels the prohibition for interest under sections 87 
and 87A of TMA. This is because interest under those sections may be taken into 
account as a loan relationship debit (see Parts 5 and 6 of this Bill). But the prohibition 
does apply to interest under section 86 of TMA, which applies for corporation tax 
purposes only for accounting periods ending before 1 October 1993. So that rule is 
&#8220;saved&#8221; by Schedule 2 to this Bill and not rewritten in this clause. 
 
3333. The table in subsection (2) sets out the specific statutory references because a 
general description of the penalties etc would not be precise enough. But the second 
column of the table is a description of the tax to indicate what is involved. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1304" SerialNumber="453">Clause 1304: Crime-related payments 
3334. This clause prohibits any deduction for expenses incurred in making a 
payment: 
 
    &#8226; the making of which is a criminal offence, or which would be a criminal 
       offence if the payment were made in the United Kingdom; or 
 
    &#8226; which is made in response to a demand, the making of which is a criminal 
       offence. 
 
3335. The clause is based on section 577A of ICTA. The corresponding rule for 
income tax is in section 870 of ITTOIA. 
 
3336. The source legislation denies a deduction for certain crime-related payments 
&#8220;in computing profits chargeable to corporation tax under Schedule D&#8221;. Profits 
chargeable to tax under Schedule D include profits of a business which is neither a 
trade nor a property business. 
 
3337. The clause applies to income charged to corporation tax. Some kinds of 
income are not charged under Schedule D in the source legislation. But the 
prohibition of a deduction is not thought to have any practical effect on income that is 
not charged under Schedule D. So the scope of the prohibition is unchanged. 
 
3338. The clause overrides any provision which otherwise allows a deduction to be 
made in calculating the profits of a trade. See clause 51(1)(b) of this Bill. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="1305" SerialNumber="454">Clause 1305: Dividends and other distributions 
3339. This clause sets out the prohibition on deducting dividends or other 
distributions made by a company in computing that company&#8217;s profits chargeable to 
corporation tax. It is based on section 337A(1)(a) of ICTA. 
 
</Clause></Chapter><Chapter Number="2" SerialNumber="455">Chapter 2: Other general rules 
<Clause Number="1306" SerialNumber="456">Clause 1306: Losses calculated on same basis as miscellaneous income 
3340. This clause is based on numerous provisions, including section 827 of ICTA. 
The corresponding rule for income tax is in section 872 of ITTOIA. 
 
3341. The application of the clause is limited to &#8220;miscellaneous income&#8221;, defined in 
subsection (3) by reference to section 834A of ICTA (inserted by Schedule 1 to this 
Bill). The source legislation does not generally limit the scope of the rule. For 
example, section 827(1) of ICTA says &#8220;the payment shall not be allowed as a 
deduction in computing any income, profits or losses for any corporation tax 
purposes&#8221;. But in practice this clause affects only the calculation for corporation tax 
purposes of amounts, other than profits within Part 3 or 4 of this Bill, chargeable 
under a provision listed in the table in section 834A of ICTA. 
 
3342. Subsection (2) ensures that this rule does not overturn any rules about the 
calculation of losses. For example, see section 398 of ICTA (which deals with the 
calculation of losses for the purposes of a claim under section 396 of ICTA). 
 
3343. See the related commentary on clause 47 of this Bill. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1307" SerialNumber="457">Clause 1307: Apportionment etc of miscellaneous profits and losses to accounting 
period 
3344. This clause provides for apportionment of profits and losses when a 
company&#8217;s period of account does not coincide with an accounting period. It is based 
on section 72 of ICTA. The corresponding rule for income tax is in sections 203 
and 871 of ITTOIA. 
 
3345. Section 72 of ICTA applies &#8220;in the case of any profits or gains chargeable&#8230; 
under Case I, II or VI of Schedule D&#8221;. Apportionment is therefore not limited to the 
case of profits or losses of a trade. See the related commentary for section 52. 
 
3346. The clause applies where income is chargeable under a provision to which 
section 834A of ICTA applies. That section is inserted by Schedule 1 to this Bill. 
Section 834A of ICTA does not apply to income to which Chapter 8 of Part 10 
(income not otherwise charged) applies which arises from a source outside the United 
Kingdom (see subsection (3) of that section). Subsection (2) of this clause qualifies 
the reference to that section so that the benefit of the apportionment rules extends to 
such income (that is, to income charged in the source legislation under Schedule D 
Case V). See Change 95 in Annex 1. 
3347. The only circumstance in which aggregation within subsection (3)(b) will 
occur is when a company is in liquidation and has fixed accounting periods of 12 
months in accordance with clause 12 of this Bill. 
 
3348. This clause does not carry over the rewrite change in section 871(5) of 
ITTOIA whereby apportionment is permitted by a measure of time other than the 
number of days in the respective periods, as required by section 72(2) of ICTA. 
HMRC consider that a day cannot fall into more than one accounting period. 
 
3349. See also the paragraph headed &#8220;miscellaneous profits and losses: 
apportionment to accounting periods ending before 1 April 2009&#8221; in Part 21 of 
Schedule 2 to the Bill which provides for a period of account that straddles the end of 
the financial year 2008 and the beginning of the financial year 2009. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1308" SerialNumber="458">Clause 1308: Expenditure brought into account in determining value of

3350. This clause provides that expenditure on research and development, if not of a 
capital nature, may be taken into account for the purposes of Part 13, even though for 
accounting purposes it has been brought into account in determining the value of an 
intangible asset. It is based on section 53 of FA 2004.

corresponding rule for income tax is in sections 13 and 14 of ITTOIA. 
 
3352. Section 966 of ITA requires deduction of tax from certain payments to 
entertainers and sportsmen and women. The section also applies in some cases to 
payments made to a person other than the performer. In those cases section 13(5) of 
ITTOIA treats the payments as made instead to the performer.

section 29 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960, section 13 of 
the Caravan Sites Act 1968 and section 8 of the Mobile Homes Act 1975. The 
corresponding rule for income tax is in section 875 of ITTOIA. 
 
3358. It effects a change in the law in two ways. First it provides a uniform 
definition of &#8220;caravan&#8221; for the whole of the United Kingdom. Second it applies that 
definition to all occurrences of &#8220;caravan&#8221; in this Bill. See Change 96 in Annex 1.

definitions in ICTA. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="1317" SerialNumber="468">Clause 1317: Meaning of &#8220;farming&#8221; and related expressions 
3361. This clause defines &#8220;farming&#8221; and &#8220;market gardening&#8221; and clarifies the 
meaning of &#8220;forestry&#8221; and &#8220;woodlands&#8221;. It is based on section 832 of ICTA and 
section 154 of FA 1995. The corresponding rules for income tax are in section 996 of 
ITA. 
 
3362. Section 832(1) of ICTA defines &#8220;farm land&#8221; and &#8220;market garden land&#8221;. It then 
goes on to say that &#8220;farming&#8221; and &#8220;market gardening&#8221; &#8220;shall be construed 
accordingly&#8221;. The reasons for this approach are largely historic and date from the time 
when the charge on farming and market gardening was under Schedule B. &#8220;Farm 
land&#8221; and &#8220;market garden land&#8221; are no longer terms used in the rules concerned with 
farming and market gardening; they remain only in the definition in section 832(1) of 
ICTA. 
 
3363. The definitions in this clause take a different approach. They define &#8220;farming&#8221; 
and &#8220;market gardening&#8221; by reference to the nature of the activity, not the land on 
which the activity is carried out. Farming excludes market gardening. 
 
3364. Farming is an activity which is given differing taxation treatment depending 
on whether or not the land is situated in the United Kingdom. Section 832(1) of ICTA 
provides that the definitions of &#8220;farm land&#8221; and &#8220;market garden land&#8221; are confined to 
land occupied in the United Kingdom. 
3365. There is no territorial restriction in the definitions in this Bill. Instead the 
territorial restriction is included in the rewrite of section 53(1) and (2) of ICTA as 
clause 36 of this Bill and not in the definitions. 
 
3366. Subsection (1) provides the definition of &#8220;farming&#8221;. It requires the land to be 
occupied wholly or mainly for the purposes of husbandry. This reflects a long- 
standing distinction in tax law between profits resulting from the taxpayer&#8217;s 
occupation of the land and profits from an activity in which occupation of the land is 
merely incidental. 
 
3367. In the first case the trader exploits or uses the land, for example, by growing 
crops or grazing animals. In the second case the trader occupies the land only because 
a physical location, such as a shop or factory, is needed from which to carry on the 
trade. Factory farming, that is the intensive rearing of fish or livestock, is not farming 
for tax purposes. This is because the animals do not live or draw their sustenance from 
the land. 
 
3368. Husbandry is a fairly old-fashioned term but one that is the subject of a 
considerable body of case law. The status of any marginal case must be determined in 
the light of that case law subject to the clarification given in subsection (2). 
 
3369. The definition of &#8220;farm land&#8221; in section 832 of ICTA excludes &#8220;any dwelling 
or domestic offices&#8221;. This clause does not repeat this exclusion of farmhouses. 
 
3370. As originally enacted, the definition of farm land in section 832(1) of ICTA 
specifically included the farmhouse and farm buildings as part of the farm land. The 
House of Lords in IRC v Korner and Others (1969), 45 TC 287 HL, held that the 
effect of this provision was that a farmhouse was an asset of the trade for which 
a 100% deduction could be obtained. This applies even if the farmhouse is used as a 
private residence. An amendment was introduced in FA 1969 to reverse the effect of 
that decision. This is why the definition of &#8220;farm land&#8221; in section 832(1) of ICTA 
excludes &#8220;any dwelling or domestic offices&#8221;. 
 
3371. In practice a farming company is allowed to make deductions in respect of 
expenditure of a revenue nature on office buildings used purely for business purposes. 
Such expenditure has always been treated as being incurred wholly and exclusively 
for the purposes of the trade and not prohibited from being deducted under 
section 74(1)(a) of ICTA. 
 
3372. Section 74(1)(c) of ICTA deals with the deduction of rent where only part of a 
dwelling house or domestic offices are used for trade purposes. Again, in practice, a 
company whose trade is farming is permitted to make deductions in respect of such 
houses and offices. 
 
3373. In the case of any other expenses of a residential property which is subject to 
dual private and business use a company is permitted to apportion these and the 
proportion attributable to trade use is allowed as a deduction. Again this treatment 
applies to farming companies. See clause 54 of this Bill (expenses not wholly and 
exclusively for trade and unconnected losses). 
 
3374. A company which wishes to claim a deduction for the proportion of expenses 
of a farmhouse attributable to trade rather than private purposes can do so through 
clause 54. Omitting the exclusion of farmhouses and domestic offices from the 
definition of farming gives statutory effect to what occurs in practice. 
 
3375. Subsection (2) identifies two specific types of activity as &#8220;husbandry&#8221; and 
therefore farming. 
 
3376. Paragraph (a) is based on the definition of market garden land in 
section 832(1) of ICTA. Hop growing is generally recognised to be farming but is 
often spoken of as taking place in a garden. This could bring it within the definition of 
&#8220;market garden land&#8221; in section 832(1) of ICTA but for the fact that hop growing is 
excluded from that definition. Subsection (2)(a) makes clear that hop growing is 
farming. 
 
3377. Paragraph (b) is based on the ordinary meaning of the word farming. Stud 
farming has generally been assumed to be farming for income tax purposes. The 
reference to &#8220;the breeding and rearing of horses and the grazing of horses in 
connection with those activities&#8221; makes clear what that activity encompasses for the 
purposes of this Bill. 
 
3378. Subsection (5) defines &#8220;market gardening&#8221;. It makes it clear that the produce 
sold must have been grown on the relevant land rather than being bought in for resale.

3388. Subsection (2) provides that the power may not be used after 31 March 2012. 
It is sensible to enable additional consequential amendments to be made in this way 
only over a limited period, and it would in any case become progressively more

Part 1: Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 
The charge to corporation tax 
3403. See the commentary on Chapter 1 of Part 2 for an explanation of the charges 
to corporation tax in this Bill. That Chapter deals with the charge to corporation tax 
on profits. 
3404. The charge under clause 2 is on amounts of income and on chargeable gains 
that together form the &#8220;profits pot&#8221;. The label &#8220;the charge to corporation tax on 
income&#8221; is explained in clause 2(2). There are examples of consequential amendments 
expressed in these terms in the amendments to section 761(1) and section 776(3A) of 
ICTA. 
 
3405. There are also consequential amendments to charges to an amount of 
corporation tax. These charges do not fall within the &#8220;profits pot&#8221; and are provisions 
of an administrative nature mainly recovering excessive relief. Two examples are the 
amendment to section 399(3) of ICTA and the amendment to paragraph 27(4) of 
Schedule 16 to FA 2002. 
 
3406. References to Schedule D Case VI are removed in these consequential 
amendments: see the commentary on the amendment inserting section 834A of ICTA. 
 
Section 15 of ICTA 
3407. Section 15(1A) of ICTA is not rewritten because it is no longer necessary. It is 
part of a framework in which income tax and corporation tax are, broadly, governed 
by the same provisions. In that context its purpose is to keep the property income of a 
non-UK resident company chargeable to income tax separate from that company&#8217;s 
property income chargeable to corporation tax. But the provisions governing income 
tax have been separated from those governing corporation tax in the rewrite. 
Specifically, Part 3 of ITTOIA deals with property income charged to income tax and 
Part 4 of this Bill deals with property income charged to corporation tax. 
Clause 3(1)(b) prevents the provisions in ITTOIA from applying to income of a non- 
resident within the charge to corporation tax. Together, this is all that is required to 
achieve the result of dividing a non-UK resident company&#8217;s property income between 
separate income tax and corporation tax property businesses. 
 
Section 42 of ICTA 
3408. Clauses 240 to 242 of this Bill rewrite the application of section 42 of ICTA 
for cases within section 42(1)(a) of ICTA (determination of amounts which may be 
chargeable to corporation tax). So section 42(1)(a) of ICTA is repealed. 
 
3409. Section 42 of ICTA continues to apply for cases within section 42(1)(b) of 
ICTA (determination of amounts which may be chargeable to income tax). 
 
Section 74 of ICTA 
3410. Section 74(1) of ICTA lists various items in respect of which no deduction is 
allowed in computing profits charged to corporation tax under Schedule D Case I. 
 
3411. Section 74(1)(f) provides that in computing the amount of the profits to be 
charged to corporation tax under Case I, no sum shall be deducted in respect of: 
 
    (f) any capital withdrawn from, or any sum employed or intended to be employed as capital in, the 
    trade &#8230;, but so that this paragraph shall not be treated as disallowing the deduction of any interest 
3412. The proposition in the second half of section 74(1)(f) of ICTA that the 
prohibition of any deduction in respect of capital should not be construed as 
disallowing the deduction of interest has been overtaken by the loan relationships 
legislation in Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 1996. 
 
3413. The tax treatment of returns from corporate debt now follows accountancy 
treatment in taxing a profit or allowing a loss at the time the return is credited or 
debited in the company&#8217;s accounts. And section 100 of FA 1996 extends the corporate 
debt regime to include interest arising other than in respect of the lending of money, 
for example interest on trade debts. 
 
3414. So the second half of section 74(1)(f) is redundant and this Bill repeals it. 
 
3415. Section 74(1)(h) of ICTA prohibits deductions for interest forgone on capital 
used in the trade or in improving the trade premises. It is unlikely that any accounts 
drawn up in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice would include a 
deduction for notional interest. So section 74(1)(h) of ICTA is redundant and this Bill 
repeals it. 
 
3416. Section 74(1)(k) of ICTA prohibits deductions for &#8220;any average loss beyond 
the actual amount of loss after adjustment&#8221;. 
 
3417. Generally accepted accountancy practice in such cases is to make a provision 
in the year of loss and review that provision in subsequent years. Without 
section 74(1)(k), the tax treatment of the average loss follows generally accepted 
accountancy practice. See Change 97 in Annex 1. 
 
3418. Section 74(1)(m) of ICTA prevents a deduction for any annuity and other 
annual payment &#8220;payable out of the profits&#8221;. Because the rule applies only to amounts 
payable &#8220;out of the profits&#8221;, it has no application to the calculation of those profits. So 
section 74(1)(m) of ICTA is redundant and this Bill repeals it. 
 
Sections 76ZA to 76ZO of ICTA 
3419. A number of rules about calculating profits apply: 
 
    &#8226; in calculating the profits of a trade (or property business); 
 
    &#8226; to the calculation of expenses of management for the purpose of section 75 of 
       ICTA; and 
 
    &#8226; to the calculation of expenses of insurance companies under section 76 of 
       ICTA. 
 
3420. This Bill rewrites the first set of rules in Part 3 or, in some cases, in Part 20. 
3421. This Bill rewrites the second set of rules in Part 16 or, in some cases, in 
Part 20. 
 
3422. This Bill does not rewrite section 76 of ICTA. Instead, it inserts sections 76ZA 
to 76ZO into ICTA, to provide a version of the rules adapted to insurance companies 
to which section 76 of ICTA applies. The new sections follow the corresponding rules 
in this Bill. So the new sections repeat the changes to the law made by this Bill. See 
(in     the     order    in     which      they    appear     in     this     Schedule) 
Changes 14, 16, 82, 12, 17, 82, 15, 18, 68, 10 and 83 in Annex 1. 
 
3423. In section 76ZN of ICTA subsection (3)(a)(ii) caters for the possibility that the 
release of a debt for car hire may be a &#8220;reversal&#8221; within section 76(7) of ICTA. In that 
case, this rule ensures that the reversal is restricted by the appropriate fraction. 
 
Section 84A of ICTA 
3424. Section 84A continues in force for income tax purposes. 
 
Section 86 of ICTA 
3425. Section 86 of ICTA allows a company to deduct the cost of an employee 
seconded to a charity or educational establishment in calculating the profits to be 
charged to corporation tax. 
 
3426. Section 86(5) of ICTA lists educational establishments in Scotland for the 
purposes of relief under section 86 of ICTA. Section 86(5)(d) of ICTA refers to &#8220;a 
self-governing school within the meaning of the Self-Governing Schools etc 
(Scotland) Act 1989&#8221;. Self-governing schools were abolished on 1 April 2003. So 
section 86(5)(d) of ICTA is redundant. 
 
Section 89 of ICTA 
3427. Section 89 of ICTA is not rewritten for corporation tax purposes. See the 
commentary on clause 55 and Change 8 in Annex 1. 
 
Section 92 of ICTA 
3428. Section 92 of ICTA applies to regional development grants under Part 2 of the 
Industrial Development Act 1982. The Industrial Development Act 1982 was repealed 
by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 2004 with effect from 22 July 2004. No applications 
under Part 2 of the 1982 Act could be made after 31 March 1988 and there are no 
payments outstanding in respect of grants made before that date. So section 92 of 
ICTA is redundant. 
 
Section 101 of ICTA 
3429. The Bill does not cater for a company carrying on a profession. So this section 
is repealed. See Change 39 in Annex 1. 
Section 116(4) of ICTA 
3430. The reference to section 834A of ICTA is to the provision inserted by this 
Schedule. 
 
Section 119(2) of ICTA 
3431. Section 119(2) of ICTA is not rewritten because it is otiose. See Change 53 in 
Annex 1. 
 
Section 209(6A) of ICTA 
3432. Section 209(6A) of ICTA provides that alternative finance return shall not be 
treated as a distribution for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts. It rewrites 
section 54(1) and (2) of FA 2006. 
 
Section 337A(2)(b) of ICTA 
3433. Section 337A(2)(b) of ICTA is not rewritten because it only duplicates other 
provisions with the same effect. 
 
3434. Section 337A(2)(b) of ICTA provides that no deduction shall be made in 
computing income for the purposes of corporation tax in respect of losses from 
intangible fixed assets which come within Schedule 29 of FA 2002 except in 
accordance with the rules of that Schedule. However section 337A(2)(b) achieves 
nothing that is not already achieved by the provisions of Schedule 29. 
Section 337A(2)(b) is expressed to apply in respect of &#8220;losses from intangible assets 
within Schedule 29&#8221;. Paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 29 states that the Schedule &#8220;also has 
effect for determining how a company&#8217;s losses in respect of intangible fixed assets are 
brought into account for the purposes of corporation tax&#8221;. And paragraph 1(3) of 
Schedule 29 states that, apart from specified exceptions, &#8220;&#8230; the amounts to be 
brought into account in accordance with this Schedule [29] in respect of any matter 
are the only amounts to be brought into account for the purposes of corporation tax in 
respect of that matter&#8221;. 
 
Section 396 of ICTA 
3435. These amendments make the adaptations necessary to this section and its 
heading as a result of the abolition of Schedule D and its Cases by this Bill. 
 
3436. The main reference in section 396(1) of ICTA to tax charged under Schedule 
D Case VI has been replaced by a reference to tax charged under or by virtue of &#8220;a 
relevant provision&#8221;. This ties in with the substituted subsection (2) which, in common 
with the approach taken generally to replacing references to Schedule D Case VI, 
refers to the table of provisions in section 834A of ICTA for this purpose but with the 
exclusion of one provision in that table. The reference to section 761(1)(b)(ii) of 
ICTA derives from the replaced section 396(2) of ICTA. 
 
3437. Section 834A of ICTA is inserted by this Schedule. It is the equivalent for 
corporation tax of the income tax provision in section 1016 of ITA. For further 
information, see the commentary in these notes on section 834A of ICTA. 
3438. See also section 436A of ICTA which excludes a loss under that section from 
relief under section 396 of ICTA and prevents any relief under the latter section being 
set against profits under section 436A. 
 
3439. The inserted section 396(2A) and (2B) of ICTA preserves relief for losses 
arising in an accounting period ending on or before 31 March 2009 against any 
income arising from a relevant provision in later accounting periods. Subsection (2B) 
reflects the commencement date for the insertion of a reference to Chapter 5 of 
Part 17 of ICTA in the superseded subsection (2). 
 
Section 399 of ICTA 
3440. Section 399(1B) of ICTA is not rewritten for corporation tax purposes. The 
loss relief provisions it restricts, in particular section 396 of ICTA (losses from 
miscellaneous transactions), cannot apply. The gains that match the losses in question 
are not chargeable to tax and so losses are not eligible for relief. This provision is the 
equivalent for corporation tax purposes of section 399(1) of ICTA. That provision was 
not rewritten but repealed by ITTOIA for the same reasons. 
 
Section 431 of ICTA 
3441. A new label &#8220;life assurance trade profits provisions&#8221; is inserted into 
section 431(2) of ICTA. It is used in various consequential amendments to the life 
assurance provisions of the Corporation Tax Acts. They include the use of the label, 
instead of &#8220;provisions applicable to Case I of Schedule D&#8221; (or some variant), in places 
such as section 434(1) of ICTA, section 83YC(10) of FA 1989 and 
section 210A(10A) of TCGA. 
 
Section 584 of ICTA 
3442. This amendment repeals section 584 of ICTA. Subsection (9) has not been 
rewritten. See Change 98 in Annex 1. 
 
Sections 586 and 587 of ICTA 
3443. These amendments repeal sections 586 and 587 of ICTA. See Change 99 in 
Annex 1. 
 
Section 695 of ICTA 
3444. This amendment repeals section 695 of ICTA. Subsection (6) has not been 
rewritten. See Change 100 in Annex 1. 
 
Section 779 of ICTA 
3445. The reference to section 834A of ICTA is to the provision inserted by this 
Schedule. 
 
Section 781 of ICTA 
3446. The reference to section 834A of ICTA is to the provision inserted by this 
Schedule. 
Section 782 of ICTA 
3447. Subsection (9) is concerned with successions. Section 337(1)(b) of ICTA and 
section 18 of ITTOIA are not concerned with successions. And section 337(1)(a) is 
not rewritten in this Bill. So the closing words of subsection (9) are no longer needed 
and this Bill omits them. 
 
Section 785 of ICTA 
3448. The reference to section 834A of ICTA is to the provision inserted by this 
Schedule. 
 
Section 798A of ICTA 
3449. Subsection (4)(a) of this section applies to all income chargeable to tax under 
Schedule D Case V. But the rule in subsection (3) applies only if there are deductions 
or expenses allowable in the calculation of the income. So the amendments by this 
Bill identify such foreign income as comprising only: 
 
    &#8226; foreign trading income (the new subsection (4)(a)); 
 
    &#8226; income from an overseas property business (the new subsection (4)(b)); and 
 
    &#8226; foreign miscellaneous income (the new subsection (4)(c)). 
 
3450. The new subsection (5) preserves the distinction between post-cessation 
receipts charged to tax by section 103 of ICTA (to which section 798A does not 
apply) and those charged to tax by section 104 of ICTA (to which section 798A does 
apply). 
 
Sections 807B to 807G of ICTA 
3451. These amendments insert sections 807B to 807G into ICTA. These sections 
rewrite double taxation relief provisions in Schedule 9 (loan relationships) to FA 1996 
and Schedules 26 (derivative contracts) and 29 (intangible fixed assets) to FA 2002. 
Those provisions were inserted in those Schedules by The Corporation Tax 
(Implementation of the Mergers Directive) Regulations (SI 2007/3186) and amended 
by The Corporation Tax (Implementation of the Mergers Directive) Regulations 2008 
(SI 2008/1579). 
 
3452. Because of the similarity of the provisions for each regime (loan relationships, 
derivative contracts and intangible fixed assets) each section deals with all three 
regimes. 
 
Section 817 of ICTA 
3453. This amendment repeals section 817 of ICTA. See Change 101 in Annex 1. 
Section 826(5A) of ICTA 
3454. Section 749A of ITTOIA rewrites the exemption from income tax in 
section 826(5) of ICTA. Section 826(5A) of ICTA, which states that the exemption 
from tax does not extend to corporation tax, is repealed with this subsection. 
 
Section 834(1) of ICTA 
3455. The partial definition of income inserted into section 834(1) of ICTA provides 
that income includes anything to which the charge to corporation tax on income 
applies. It reflects the fact that, where something that is not income by nature is made 
subject to the charge on income, it is impliedly treated as income for corporation tax 
purposes. . 
 
3456.   The terms of the partial definition assume you know what the charge on 
income applies to. Therefore, its relevance is confined to contexts other than defining 
the application of the charge. As with the other definitions in section 834(1), the 
partial definition does not apply if the context otherwise requires. 
 
Section 834A of ICTA 
3457. This amendment provides for the purposes of corporation tax the equivalent of 
section 1016 of ITA. 
 
3458. This Bill omits the Schedules and the cases of Schedule D under which most 
income has been charged. There are various places in the Corporation Tax Acts, 
notably section 396 of ICTA, where there is a need to refer generically to the charging 
scope of Schedule D Case VI. 
 
3459. This amendment inserts section 834A of ICTA. The section provides a list that 
replicates the scope of Schedule D Case VI so far as relevant to those generic 
references in the Corporation Tax Acts to Case VI. As in the income tax equivalent, 
the list omits those purely administrative uses of Case VI to recover excess relief, 
over-repayments of tax and the like, to which the generic references of Case VI have 
no application. 
 
3460. Section 834A(3) of ICTA excludes from the list certain foreign income 
charged under Chapter 8 of Part 10 of this Bill (which deals with income not 
otherwise charged, whether the source is in or outside the United Kingdom), as such 
income is not within Schedule D Case VI. 
 
Section 842 of ICTA 
3461. This amendment includes the insertion of subsections (2D) and (2E) in 
section 842 of ICTA. It is based on paragraph 39 of Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
Section 843C of ICTA 
3462. This amendment inserts a new section into ICTA. The explanation of &#8220;total 
profits&#8221; follows the use of the expression in section 9(3) of ICTA. 
Paragraph 5 of Schedule 30 to ICTA 
3463. This amendment repeals paragraph 5 of Schedule 30 to ICTA. See 
Change 102 in Annex 1. 
 
Part 2: Other enactments 
TMA 
Section 12AE of TMA 
3464. This Bill legislates the &#8220;Crown Option&#8221;. So this section is not needed and is 
repealed. See Change 55 in Annex 1. 
 
Section 19(2) of TMA 
3465. This subsection is obsolete because sections 34 to 36 of ICTA have not 
charged sums under Schedule D Case VI since 1 April 1998. 
 
Section 31(3) of TMA 
3466. This Bill legislates the &#8220;Crown Option&#8221;. So this section is not needed and is 
repealed. See Change 55 in Annex 1. 
 
Section 42(7) of TMA 
3467. A number of trading income rules which require a claim in the source 
legislation are rewritten without that requirement. As a consequence the references in 
this section to claims under sections 84, 91B and 101(2) of ICTA and section 43(5) of 
FA 1989 are removed without replacement. See Changes 28, 38, 39 and 68 in 
Annex 1. 
 
Section 109A of TMA 
3468. The residence rules in section 66 of FA 1988 and section 249 of FA 1994 
apply for the purposes of the Taxes Acts as defined in section 118 of TMA. This Bill 
rewrites those rules for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts (Chapter 3 of 
Part 2). Because the Corporation Tax Acts are defined more narrowly (Schedule 1 to 
the Interpretation Act 1978) than the Taxes Acts, this new section is introduced into 
TMA to apply to that Act the rules given in Chapter 3 of Part 2. 
 
IHTA 
Section 91 of IHTA 
3469. Section 91 of IHTA currently refers to Part 16 of ICTA for the meaning of 
&#8220;charges on residue&#8221;. This term has not been rewritten in this Bill and therefore the 
meaning is inserted into section 91 of IHTA. See the commentary on clause 947. 
 
FA 1988 
Paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 12 to FA 1988 
3470. This Schedule deals with the change of status of building societies. The rule in 
this paragraph prevents the change of status from being a discontinuance of the 
building society&#8217;s trade for the purposes of CAA. 
3471. The main rules about what is a discontinuance for the purposes of CAA are in 
section 577 of CAA (and sections 558 and 559 deal with, respectively, partnership 
changes and successions). This Bill is drafted on the basis of a company starting or 
ceasing to carry on a trade etc, rather than on the basis of a trade etc commencing or 
being discontinued. So section 337(1)(a) of ICTA is not specially rewritten and there 
is no longer any rule that treats any event as the equivalent of the setting up, 
commencement or discontinuance of a trade etc. It follows that paragraph 3(1) of 
Schedule 12 to FA 1988 is no longer needed and this Bill repeals it. 
 
TCGA 
Section 59 of TCGA 
3472. This section is amended to rewrite section 115(5) to (5C) of ICTA so far as it 
applies to chargeable gains of a company. The addition of the words &#8220;so far as 
providing for that relief&#8221; make clear that the rule (for both capital gains tax and 
corporation tax) goes no further than removing any exemption for chargeable gains in 
a double taxation arrangement. See Change 87 in Annex 1. 
 
Sections 116A and 116B of TCGA 
3473. These amendments insert two new provisions rewriting section 91G(1) of, 
and (2) and paragraph 5 of Schedule 10 to, FA 1996 respectively. These two 
provisions within the loan relationships regime (Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 1996) are, 
in essence, capital gains provisions. 
 
Sections 151E to 151G of TCGA 
3474. These amendments insert new provisions which rewrite parts of both the loan 
relationships regime (Chapter 2 of Part 4 of FA 1996) and the rules on alternative 
finance arrangements in FA 2005 (rewritten as part of the loan relationships regime in 
Part 6 of the Bill). These provisions are, in essence, capital gains provisions. 
 
3475. Section 151E, which rewrites section 84A(8) of FA 1996, is to be repealed 
from an appointed day (see Part 8 (loan relationships) of Schedule 2). 
 
Sections 156ZA and 156ZB of TCGA 
3476. These amendments insert new provisions which rewrite those parts of the 
intangible assets regime in Schedule 29 to FA 2002 which are, in essence, capital 
gains provisions. 
 
3477. This includes those parts of paragraph 132 of Schedule 29 to FA 2002 which 
have permanent effect. Paragraph 132(2) to (4) provides rules of transition dealing 
only with a temporary overlap of the capital gains and intangible fixed assets regimes 
(unless there is an extension under section 152(3) of TCGA of the time limit) and can 
never be relevant to disposals after 31 March 2003. So they are not rewritten. 
 
Section 158 of TCGA 
3478. This Bill is drafted on the basis of a company starting or ceasing to carry on a 
trade etc, rather than on the basis of a trade etc commencing or being discontinued. So 
section 337(1)(a) of ICTA is not specially rewritten and there is no longer any rule 
that requires an event to be regarded as the equivalent of the setting up, 
commencement or discontinuance of a trade etc. It follows that the closing words of 
section 158(2) of TCGA are no longer needed and this Bill omits them. 
 
Section 286A of TCGA 
3479. The residence rules in section 66 of FA 1988 and section 249 of FA 1994 
apply for the purposes of the Taxes Acts as defined in section 118 of TMA. This Bill 
rewrites those rules for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts (Chapter 3 of 
Part 2). Because the Corporation Tax Acts are defined more narrowly (Schedule 1 to 
the Interpretation Act 1978) than the Taxes Acts, this new section is introduced into 
TCGA to apply to that Act the rules given in Chapter 3 of Part 2. 
 
FA 1995 
Section 126 of FA 1995 
3480. This section no longer applies for corporation tax purposes, following the 
amendment of it by FA 2003 and the enactment of the scheme of corporation tax for 
non-United Kingdom resident companies. In subsection (7A)(b) the reference to 
section 114 of ICTA would need amendment but the whole of paragraph (b) is no 
longer needed and so is repealed by this Bill. 
 
Section 127 of FA 1995 
3481. This amendment is a consequence of removing the term &#8220;profit share return&#8221; 
from the provisions covering alternative finance arrangements. Refer to the 
commentary on clause 513. Sub-paragraph (ca) is amended to include what is 
currently profit share return under section 49A of FA 2005 and sub-paragraph (cb) 
can be omitted. 
 
FA 1998 
Paragraph 84 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 
3482. Paragraph 84 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 makes administrative provision for 
HMRC to operate the &#8220;Crown Option&#8221; under which they may determine which Case 
of Schedule D applies if an item falls within more than one Case of that Schedule. 
 
3483. This Bill provides priority rules for all such possible overlaps (see, for 
example, clause 982 (provisions which must be given priority over Part 10)). These 
reflect how the Crown Option is applied. So the administrative provisions in 
paragraph 84 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 are redundant. See Change 55 in Annex 1. 
 
FA 1999 
Section 63 of FA 1999 
3484. Section 63 of FA 1999 provides transitional relief to mitigate the effect on 
football and other sports clubs of new accounting standards for the treatment of 
intangible assets. 
3485. Section 63 of FA 1999 applies only to contracts entered into before the 
beginning of the first accounting period in which a club adopts the new accounting 
standards. The new accounting rules are effective for accounting periods ending on or 
after 23 December 1998. So section 63 applies only to contracts entered into before 24 
December 1999. 
 
3486. It is unlikely that any contract entered into before 24 December 1999 will still 
be in force when this Bill comes into effect. So section 63 of FA 1999 is considered to 
be redundant. See Change 103 in Annex 1. 
 
FA 2000 
Section 46 of FA 2000 
3487. The amendments to this section include those needed to replace the references 
to Schedule D Case I or VI, as a result of the omission by this Bill of the Schedules 
and the cases of Schedule D. The reference to section 834A of ICTA is to the 
provision inserted by this Schedule. 
 
3488. A number of the references in subsection (2A) have been omitted as 
unnecessary. These are not within the provisions listed in section 834A of ICTA to 
which subsection (2) now refers. But they are not in fact relevant to the exemption in 
this section, which applies to income &#8220;applied solely for the purposes of the charitable 
company&#8221; (subsection (3)). The omitted references all provide for a recovery of tax or 
similar charge and therefore do not represent income of the charity that could be so 
applied. 
 
CAA 
Sections 108, 112, 115, 263 265, 559 and 577 of CAA 
3489. This Bill is drafted on the basis of a company starting or ceasing to carry on a 
trade etc, rather than on the basis of a trade etc commencing or being discontinued. 
The amendments to these sections reflect this change of approach. See Change 104 in 
Annex 1. 
 
FA 2002 
Paragraph 141 of Schedule 29 to FA 2002 
3490. Paragraph 141 of Schedule 29 to FA 2002 is not rewritten. Paragraph 141(2) 
provides that references in Schedule 29 to the Inland Revenue are, subject to stated 
exceptions, references to any officer of the Board. The exceptions mentioned in 
paragraph 141(1) are in relation to the discretionary extension of the time limits for 
group relief under Part 6 of Schedule 29 and for reinvestment relief under Part 7 of 
Schedule 29 and in relation to clearance applications in respect of specified provisions 
in Part 11 of Schedule 29. In the case of these exceptions &#8220;Inland Revenue&#8221; means the 
Board. Matters to be dealt with by the Board are traditionally those requiring the 
exercise of judgement and discretion in particularly sensitive areas. The &#8220;Board&#8221; here 
is stated to mean the Commissioners for Inland Revenue reflecting directly the 
defined usage of terms in section 1(1) of TMA. 
3491. Paragraph 141 of Schedule 29 to FA 2002 provides a way for Schedule 29 to 
make the necessary references to Revenue officers while preserving the distinction 
between functions that could be performed at an &#8220;ordinary&#8221; level in the department 
and those that could not. The terminology has however been overtaken by the creation 
of HMRC and the provisions of CRCA. If paragraph 141 were rewritten, it would be 
necessary to translate there the references to &#8220;Board&#8221;, &#8220;Inland Revenue&#8221; and 
&#8220;Commissioners for Inland Revenue&#8221; into the post-CRCA equivalents while 
preserving the &#8220;special treatment&#8221; in respect of the provisions referred to in 
paragraph 141(1). 
 
3492. However this is not necessary. A general interpretative provision is 
appropriate when the intangible fixed assets rules are set out in a separate Finance Act 
Schedule. But in the Bill, these rules are part of the main body of the corporation tax 
rules. So the appropriate post-CRCA term is simply inserted into each provision. 
 
3493. For intended references to &#8220;any officer of the Board&#8221; under the general rule in 
paragraph 141(2) of Schedule 29 to FA 2002, the post-CRCA term is &#8220;any officer of 
Revenue and Customs&#8221; (section 50(1) of CRCA). 
 
3494. For intended references to the &#8220;Commissioners for Inland Revenue&#8221; under the 
specific rule in paragraph 141(1) and (3) of Schedule 29 to FA 2002, the post CRCA 
term is the &#8220;Commissioners for Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs&#8221; (sections 1(1) 
and 50(1) of CRCA). However, as explained in the notes relating to the clauses 
involved, changes are proposed in respect of paragraph 35(2) of Schedule 29 to 
FA 2002 (rewritten as clause 753(2)) and paragraph 39(1)(a) of Schedule 29 to 
FA 2002 (rewritten as clause 756(1)) to reflect the fact that the power attributed there 
to the Commissioners for HMRC is, in practice, exercised by an officer of HMRC 
(see also Change 1 in Annex 1). 
 
3495. It is not necessary to rewrite the final sentence in paragraph 141(1) of 
Schedule 29 to FA 2002 which refers to the authority to delegate Board&#8217;s functions. 
Under section 13 of CRCA practically all functions of the Commissioners are stated 
to be delegable to an officer of the Department. The established rewrite approach to 
denoting a function as proper to the Commissioners for HMRC is to leave section 13 
of CRCA to spell out that it need not be carried out by the Commissioners personally. 
 
Paragraph 142 of Schedule 29 to FA 2002 
3496. This definitional provision in not rewritten because it is superseded in the Bill. 
 
Paragraph 143 of Schedule 29 to FA 2002 
3497. An index of definitions is included in a Bill-wide Schedule so paragraph 143 is 
not rewritten. 
Energy Act 2004 
Sections 28 and 44 of the Energy Act 2004 
3498. The reference to section 834A of ICTA is to the provision inserted by this 
Schedule. 
 
ITTOIA 
Section 48 of ITTOIA 
3499. Section 48 of ITTOIA restricts the amount which can be deducted in 
calculating the profits of a trade for income tax purposes in respect of the cost of the 
hire of a car or motor cycle with a retail price (when new) of more than &#163;12,000 other 
than &#8220;a qualifying hire car or motor cycle&#8221;. 
 
3500. The amendments in this paragraph remedy two errors in section 48 of 
ITTOIA. 
 
3501. Section 578A(4) of ICTA restricts a recovery charge if any deduction has been 
restricted under section 578A(3). Section 48(3) of ITTOIA deals only with a previous 
restriction under section 48(2). The amendment extends the restriction on the recovery 
charge to cases where the original restriction was made to any other deduction. 
 
3502. Section 48(4) of ITTOIA refers to a &#8220;rebate or release&#8221; but neither paragraph 
of the subsection deals with a rebate. The amendment to paragraph (a) ensures that the 
subsection applies to rebates as well as to releases of debts. 
 
3503. See Change 83 in Annex 1. 
 
Section 49 of ITTOIA 
3504. Section 48 of ITTOIA restricts the amount which can be deducted in 
calculating the profits of a trade for income tax purposes in respect of the cost of the 
hire of a car or motor cycle with a retail price (when new) of more than &#163;12,000 other 
than &#8220;a qualifying hire car or motor cycle&#8221;. 
 
3505. This amendment remedies a small omission in the definition in section 49 of 
ITTOIA of &#8220;qualifying hire car&#8221; for the purpose of section 48 of ITTOIA. See 
Change 105 in Annex 1. 
 
Sections 79, 79A and 80 of ITTOIA 
3506. These amendments clarify the operation of ITTOIA in cases where there is a 
change in the persons carrying on a trade etc. See Change 17 in Annex 1. 
 
Sections 155 of ITTOIA 
3507. This amendment allows as a deduction all levies and costs under FISMA. See 
Change 22 in Annex 1. 
Sections 175 to 184 of ITTOIA 
3508. These amendments cater for the possibilities that trading stock is transferred to 
a person carrying on a profession or vocation or that work in progress is transferred to 
a person carrying on trade. See Change 39 in Annex 1. 
 
Section 303 of ITTOIA 
3509. This amends Rule 1 in section 303 of ITTOIA so that the rule remains the 
same for income tax as it is for corporation tax. See Change 50 in Annex 1. 
 
Section 860 of ITTOIA 
3510. This amendment makes clear that the section applies to property businesses. 
See Change 88 in Annex 1. 
 
Section 749A of ITTOIA 
3511. Section 749A of ITTOIA rewrites section 826(5) of ICTA which was 
overlooked in the preparation of ITTOIA. It exempts from income tax interest on 
corporation tax repayments. 
 
Sections 861 and 862 of ITTOIA 
3512. These amendments make clear how the rules about spreading receipts from the 
sale of patent rights apply when there is a change in persons carrying on a trade. See 
Change 89 in Annex 1. 
 
FA 2005 
Section 49(2) of FA 2005 
3513. This amendment is a consequence of replacing the term &#8220;profit share return&#8221; 
with &#8220;alternative finance return&#8221;. Refer to the commentary on clause 513. 
Amendments for the same reason are also required for sections 49A, 51, 52, 56 and 57 
of FA 2005. 
 
FA 2006 
Sections 46 and 47 of FA 2006 
3514. The provisions about film production companies, film tax relief and 
supporting definitions in sections 31 to 36 of FA 2006 are rewritten. Those definitions 
are repealed along with the other provisions that are rewritten. But since those 
FA 2006 definitions also apply for the purposes of sections 46 and 47 of FA 2006 
(withdrawal of existing reliefs), this amendment ensures that the rewritten definitions 
apply for the purposes of sections 46 and 47 of FA 2006. 
 
Section 121 of FA 2006 
3515. Section 114(1)(a) of ICTA does not apply to payments received by companies 
carrying on a trade etc in partnership. So subsection (4) of this section is repealed. See 
Change 85 in Annex 1. 
Paragraph 28 of Schedule 10 to FA 2006 
3516. This paragraph determines a company&#8217;s share in the profits or losses of a 
business. Sub-paragraph (2) refers to section 114(2) of ICTA. That reference is 
replaced by one to clause 1262 of this Bill. 
 
3517. Clauses 1263 and 1264 legislate a non-statutory practice (see Change 86 in 
Annex 1). The rules in those clauses would not have been taken into account for the 
purposes of Schedule 10 to FA 2006. So they are excluded by the amendment. 
 
3518. The reference in sub-paragraph (2)(b) to a share in capital allowances and 
balancing charges has no effect because such allowances and charges are taken into 
account in calculating the profits or losses of the business. So paragraph (b) is not 
reproduced in the amendment. 
 
ITA 
Section 835A of ITA 
3519. The residence rules in section 66 of FA 1988 and section 249 of FA 1994 
apply for the purposes of the Taxes Acts as defined in section 118 of TMA. This Bill 
rewrites those rules for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts (Chapter 3 of 
Part 2). Because the Corporation Tax Acts are defined more narrowly (Schedule 1 to 
the Interpretation Act 1978) than the Taxes Acts, this new section is introduced into 
ITA to apply the rules given in Chapter 3 of Part 2 for the purposes of income tax. 
 
</Schedule><Schedule Number="2" SerialNumber="483">Schedule 2: Transitionals and savings 
Part 1: General provisions 
3520. These paragraphs ensure continuity of the law, despite the fact that this Bill 
repeals and rewrites provisions. 
 
3521. Paragraph 2 makes clear that the proposition about the continuity of the law in 
paragraph 1 does not apply to changes in the law made by this Bill. 
 
3522. The paragraphs in this Part stand instead of section 17(2) of the Interpretation 
Act 1978 and provide a comprehensive set of transitional arrangements. 
 
Part 2: Changes in the law 
3523. This paragraph allows anyone affected by a minor change in the law made by 
this Bill to elect that the change does not apply to events occurring before 1 
April 2009. This allows the Bill to be applied as soon as possible without imposing 
charges retrospectively. 
 
Part 3: Charge to corporation tax on income 
Effect of repeal of section 9(1) of ICTA on relevance of case law 
3524. The case law to which the saving is relevant is the case law relating to the 
construction of source legislation rewritten in the Bill whose application for 
corporation tax purposes depended on section 9(1) of ICTA (which applies income 
tax principles for corporation tax purposes). 

 
Part 5: Company residence: exceptions to section 14 
3525. These paragraphs apply where a company incorporated in the United Kingdom 
carried on business before 15 March 1988, the commencement date for section 66 of 
FA 1988 (rewritten in Chapter 3 of Part 2). These paragraphs rewrite parts of 
paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 of Schedule 7 to FA 1988. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of that Schedule 
are spent. 
 
3526. United Kingdom incorporated companies which received Treasury consent to 
migrate from the United Kingdom before the commencement date (paragraph 1) and 
those with an application in the pipeline before the commencement date (paragraph 2) 
retain their foreign residence (despite clause 14) until they cease to carry on business 
or become resident in the United Kingdom under other rules. The provision for the 
Treasury to consent to company migrations (most recently section 765 of ICTA) was 
repealed with effect from the commencement date for section 66 of FA 1988. 
 
Part 6: Trading income 
Reserves of marketing authorities etc 
3527. This paragraph makes clear that the status of schemes or arrangements 
approved by or made with the National Assembly for Wales before 26 May 2007 is 
preserved. See Change 15 in Annex 1. 
 
Part 7: Property income 
Lease premiums: time limits for claims for repayment of tax 
3528. This paragraph provides that the time limit for claims for repayment of tax 
under clause 238 or 239 is six years after the events described in those clauses. This 
preserves the period of six years mentioned in section 36(2)(b) of ICTA (charge on 
sale of land with right to reconveyance) until the Treasury make an order under this 
paragraph. 
 
Part 8: Loan relationships 
Exemption for interest on tax overpaid for accounting periods ending before 1 
July 1999 
3529. Section 34 of FA 1998 removed the exemption from corporation tax for 
interest under section 826(1) of ICTA (interest on tax overpaid) for payments made in 
accounting periods ending on or after 1 July 1999. Section 826(5A) of ICTA, which 
provides that the exemption does not apply for corporation tax purposes, is not 
rewritten in this Bill as the interest naturally falls to be charged as income by Part 5 of 
this Bill. 
 
5&#189;% Treasury Stock 2008-2012 not redeemed before 6 April 2009 
3530. Because this Treasury Stock may be redeemed within a maximum of three 
years the exemption from charge under Part 5 for amounts other than interest 
(section 96(2) of FA 1996) is rewritten in this Schedule. See the commentary in the 
overview of Chapter 12 of Part 5. 

 
Part 10: Derivative contracts 
Extended meaning of reference in section 591(6)(b) 
3531. This paragraph extends the list of provisions relevant to condition E in 
clause 591 (conditions A to E mentioned in section 589(5)). It is based on paragraph 
4(2D) of Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
Disapplication of section 645 
3532. This paragraph disapplies clause 645 (creditor relationships: embedded 
derivatives which are options) to a derivative contract if paragraph 9(2) of 
Schedule 10 to FA 2004 has effect in relation to the asset representing the creditor 
relationship which hosts the derivative contract. It is based on paragraphs 12(11C) 
and 45D(2) and (4) of Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
3533. That provision of FA 2004 deems an asset representing a creditor relationship 
no longer to be such if the asset was in existence at a date not later than 31 
December 2005. See the following paragraphs for the rules that apply if a derivative 
contract would be within clause 645 if this paragraph did not apply. 
 
Existing assets representing creditor relationships: options 
3534. This paragraph, supplemented by the next two, disapplies clause 574 (non- 
trading credits and debits to be brought into account under Part 5) in respect of a 
derivative contract and modifies the application of TCGA in respect of the &#8220;original 
creditor relationship&#8221; mentioned in clause 645 (creditor relationships: embedded 
derivatives which are options), if that clause would have applied to the derivative 
contract but for the disapplication in the preceding paragraph. This paragraph is based 
on paragraphs 12(11C) and (11D), 45A(2) and 45FA(1), (3), (4), (6) and (8) of 
Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
3535. Sub-paragraph (2) disapplies clause 574 in respect of the &#8220;relevant credits and 
debits&#8221; arising on the option. Any gain or loss on the exercise or abandonment of the 
option is dealt with under the provisions of TCGA, as those provisions apply to the 
creditor relationship. &#8220;Relevant credits and debits&#8221; are defined in clause 659. 
 
3536. The first modification of TCGA in respect of the original creditor relationship, 
in sub-paragraph (3), is the same as that made by clause 645(8). The creditor 
relationship is not treated as a &#8220;qualifying corporate bond&#8221; although section 117(A1) 
of TCGA would otherwise treat it as such. 
 
3537. The second modification, in sub-paragraph (4), is to the amount or value of 
the consideration applicable to the asset representing the creditor relationship on a 
disposal of that asset. So much of any interest in respect of the creditor relationship as 
is brought into account under Part 5 (loan relationships) but, because of the terms of 
the disposal, is not paid or payable to the company to which it accrues, is deducted 
from the consideration. In effect, the charge under that Part is given priority over the 
charge to corporation tax on chargeable gains. 
3538. The third modification, in sub-paragraph (6), also affects the amount of that 
consideration. It adjusts that amount for any &#8220;relevant exchange gains&#8221; and &#8220;relevant 
exchange losses&#8221;, as those terms are defined in the paragraph below. The 
consideration is first increased by any such losses and then reduced by any such gains. 
If that reduction would exceed the amount of the consideration, that amount becomes 
nil and, under sub-paragraph (7), the excess is added to incidental costs of acquisition 
under section 38 of TCGA. 
 
3539. The definition of &#8220;relevant exchange gains&#8221; and &#8220;relevant exchange losses&#8221; 
refers to such gains and losses in respect of the asset representing the creditor 
relationship as are brought into account under Part 5 (loan relationships) for an 
accounting period throughout which the company holds the asset. Gains and losses are 
apportioned as necessary if the company only holds the asset for part of an accounting 
period. The effect of the adjustments to the consideration is to reverse the application 
of that Part to exchange gains and losses in respect of the asset in question so that 
those exchange adjustments are taken into account only in the chargeable gains 
arising in respect of the asset representing the creditor relationship. 
 
3540. The second of these paragraphs provides definitions for the purposes of the 
first paragraph. It is based on paragraphs 12(11C) and 45FA(7) of Schedule 26 to 
FA 2002. 
 
3541. The third of these paragraphs provides for the meaning in the first paragraph 
of the asset representing the creditor relationship if there has been a reorganisation of 
share capital. It is based on paragraphs 12(11C) and 45FA(5) of Schedule 26 to 
FA 2002. 
 
Disapplication of section 648 
3542. This paragraph disapplies clause 648 (creditor relationships: embedded 
derivatives which are exactly tracking contracts for differences) to a derivative 
contract if paragraph 11(2) of Schedule 10 to FA 2004 has effect in relation to the 
asset representing the creditor relationship. It is based on paragraphs 12(11C) 
and 45F(2) and (7) of Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
3543. That provision of FA 2004 deems an asset representing a creditor relationship 
linked to the value of assets no longer to be such if the asset was in existence at a date 
not later than 31 December 2005. See the following paragraphs for the rules that apply 
if a derivative contract would be within clause 648 if this paragraph did not apply. 
 
Existing assets representing creditor relationships: contracts for differences 
3544. This paragraph and the next one make, with one exception, corresponding 
provision in respect of a derivative contract and its host contract, if clause 648 
(creditor relationships: embedded derivatives which are exactly tracking contracts for 
differences) would apply to the derivative contract but for the disapplication in the 
preceding paragraph, to that made by the paragraphs above for &#8220;existing assets 
representing creditor relationships: options&#8221;. The exception is that these paragraphs do 
not provide specially for exchange gains and losses (&#8220;relevant exchange gains&#8221; and 
&#8220;relevant exchange losses&#8221; in the earlier paragraphs). These paragraphs are based on 
paragraphs 12(11C) and (11D) and 45FA(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Schedule 26 to FA 
2002. 
 
Disapplication of section 658 
3545. This paragraph disapplies clause 658 (chargeable gain or allowable loss 
treated as accruing when certain debtor relationships come to an end) to a derivative 
contract (and makes a consequential provision) if the liability representing the debtor 
relationship that hosts the derivative contract was owed before a date that is usually in 
2005. It is based on paragraphs 45K(2) and 45KA(1) of Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
3546. The consequential provision is that, if clause 658 would apply to a derivative 
contract but for this paragraph, this paragraph disapplies clause 574 (non-trading 
credits and debits to be brought into account under Part 5) in respect of the relevant 
credits and debits arising on the derivative contract. Any gain or loss arising on the 
contract for differences is dealt with under the provisions of TCGA, as those 
provisions apply to the liability representing the debtor relationship. &#8220;Relevant 
credits&#8221; and &#8220;relevant debits&#8221; are defined in clause 659. 
 
Disapplication of section 661 
3547. This paragraph disapplies clause 661 (contract which became derivative 
contract) if the time when the relevant contract became a derivative contract was 
before 30 December 2006 (the date by reference to which the amendments made by 
the Finance Act 2002, Schedule 26, (Parts 2 and 9) (Amendment) Order 2006 
(SI 2006/3269) have effect.). It is based on paragraph 43A(4) of Schedule 26 to 
FA 2002. 
 
Disapplication of section 666 
3548. This paragraph disapplies clause 666 (allowable loss treated as accruing where 
amount paid in discharge of obligations under debtor relationship) if the liability 
representing the debtor relationship was owed before a date which is usually in 2005. 
It is based on paragraph 45JA(1) and (2) of Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
Contracts which became derivative contracts on 16 March 2005 
3549. This paragraph brings into account as a chargeable gain or allowable loss, 
when a company ceases to be a party to the contract, the gain or loss latent in a 
contract that became a derivative contract from 3.00pm on 16 March 2005 (the time at 
which the 2005 Budget announced proposed changes to the definition of what is a 
derivative contract). It is based on paragraph 4A(1), (2) and (3) of Schedule 26 to 
FA 2002. 
 
3550. A contract that was not a derivative contract before that time but became one 
after that time is commonly one that formerly met the conditions for its underlying 
subject matter to be &#8220;excluded property&#8221; (see the commentary on clause 589 
(contracts excluded because of underlying subject matter: general)). The Finance 
Act 2002, Schedule 26, Parts 2 and 9 (Amendment) Order 2005 (SI 2005/646) 
amended the conditions for that purpose from that time to cut down the range of 
excluded property (see the conditions in clause 591 (conditions A to E mentioned in 
section 589(5))). Rather than covering most cases where the underlying subject matter 
of the contract is shares, either by themselves or in conjunction with holdings in 
shares, the excluded property rule now focuses on contracts used to hedge assets 
which are shares on which chargeable gains arise. 
 
3551. The paragraph only applies if the contract was a &#8220;chargeable asset&#8221; 
immediately before it became a derivative contract (see the definition of that term in 
clause 703). 
 
3552. Sub-paragraph (5) requires a chargeable gain or allowable loss to be brought 
into account on the assumption the company disposed of the contract immediately 
before it became a derivative contract and did so for consideration equal to the book 
value of the contract (if any) at the end of the last accounting period of the company 
before that to which the changes made by SI 2005/646 apply. 
 
3553. Paragraph (b) of sub-paragraph (6) defines that period. In the source 
legislation, the words used are &#8220;the company&#8217;s accounting period immediately before 
its first new period&#8221;. The term &#8220;new period&#8221; is not otherwise used in SI 2005/646. But 
a &#8220;new period&#8221; cannot predate the first period to which the amendments made by 
those regulations apply (as set out in article 1 of SI 2005/646). The paragraph has 
therefore been aligned with the commencement terms of SI 2005/646. See 
Change 106 in Annex 1. 
 
Contracts which became derivative contracts on 28 July 2005 
3554. This paragraph treats a relevant contract to which it applies as a derivative 
contract entered into by a company on 28 July 2005 and determines the value of the 
consideration given for the contract. It also brings into account as a chargeable gain or 
allowable loss when the company ceases to be a party to the contract the gain or loss 
latent in the contract at 28 July 2005. It is based on paragraph 4B(1), (2), (3) and (4) 
of Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
3555. The Finance Act 2002, Schedule 26, Parts 2 and 9 (Amendment No 2) 
Order 2005 (SI 2005/2082) extends the scope of the amendments made by 
SI 2005/646 to the &#8220;excluded property&#8221; rules (see clause 589 (contracts excluded 
because of underlying subject matter: general)). See the comments on the amendment 
of the &#8220;excluded property&#8221; rules in connection with the preceding paragraph. 
 
3556. A contract to which this paragraph applies is one that was not a derivative 
contract immediately before 28 July 2005 (although it was a &#8220;chargeable asset&#8221; at that 
point). But it would have been a derivative contract had an accounting period of the 
company begun on that date, that is, when the amendments made by SI 2005/2082 
came into force. Because of the rule in this case, it is immaterial when the actual 
accounting period of the company began in which 28 July 2005 falls. 
3557. The definition of &#8220;chargeable asset&#8221; in clause 703 applies. 
 
3558. Sub-paragraph (6) brings into account the chargeable gain or allowable loss 
latent in the contract at the time it is treated as becoming a derivative contract. It does 
so in the same way as the preceding paragraph with one exception. This is that the 
consideration for the disposal is equal to the fair value of the contract on 28 July 2005 
(that is, the same figure as is taken to be the consideration for the deemed derivative 
contract in the subsequent application of Part 7 to the contract). 
 
Plain vanilla contracts which became derivative contracts before 30 December 2006 
3559. This paragraph modifies the amounts otherwise allowable as acquisition costs 
under section 38 of TCGA on the disposal of a plain vanilla contract if the disposal 
occurs because the company ceases to be a party to the contract. It is based on 
paragraph 4D of Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
3560. There are two conditions to be met. The first is that the plain vanilla contract 
was previously not a derivative contract but became one at a date before 30 
December 2006. Although the paragraph does not specify in what circumstances the 
contract became a derivative contract, it is likely to be the case that it had ceased to 
satisfy the conditions in clause 589 (contracts excluded because of underlying subject 
matter: general) under which the underlying subject matter of the contract was 
&#8220;excluded property&#8221;. 
 
3561. The second condition is that neither of the two preceding paragraphs applies 
on the company ceasing to be a party to the contract. 
 
3562. 30 December 2006 is the date by reference to which the amendments made by 
the Finance Act 2002, Schedule 26, (Parts 2 and 9) (Amendment) Order 2006 
(SI 2006/3269) have effect. 
 
3563. Sub-paragraph (2) disapplies clause 699 (priority of Part 7 for corporation tax 
purposes) in respect of a disposal to which this paragraph applies (that is, the 
provisions of this paragraph do not exhaust the application of the Corporation Tax 
Acts to this disposal). 
 
3564. The adjustments made by this paragraph to the acquisition costs allowable 
under section 38 of TCGA are similar to those made by a number of provisions in 
Chapter 8 of Part 7. As with those clauses, this paragraph in effect reverses the 
treatment of credits and debits in respect of the derivative contract so that double 
counting is avoided when the contract is disposed of. 
 
3565. And similarly again to those clauses, if the adjustment to be made under sub- 
paragraph (3) is a reduction that exceeds the amounts otherwise allowable under 
section 38 of TCGA, the excess is added to the consideration for the disposal. 
 
3566. &#8220;Plain vanilla contract&#8221; is defined in clause 708. 
Issuers of securities with embedded derivatives: deemed options 
3567. This paragraph disapplies clauses 653 and 655 and varies the application of 
clause 654 in a case where the company was a party to the debtor relationship in 
question immediately before its first accounting period to begin on or after 1 
January 2005. It is based on paragraph 45J(4) of Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
3568. The paragraph preserves the commencement rules that apply on the insertion 
of paragraph 45J of Schedule 26 to FA 2002. 
 
Contract becoming derivative contract on 12 March 2008 
3569. This paragraph determines the consideration treated as given for a relevant 
contract that became a derivative contract on 12 March 2008 by virtue of certain 
provisions of FA 2008. It is based on paragraph 20 of Schedule 22 to FA 2008. 
 
3570. Paragraph 20 of Schedule 22 to FA 2008 amends the source legislation for 
clauses 579(1) and 589(5) with effect from 12 March 2008, the effect of which is that 
a number of relevant contracts became derivative contracts. This paragraph 
determines the consideration treated as given for such a derivative contract so that the 
provisions setting out the credits and debits to be brought into account under Part 7 
may be applied. 
 
Avoidance relying on continuity of treatment provisions: transactions before 16 
May 2008 
3571. This paragraph preserves the commencement rules applying on the 
introduction of the source legislation for clause 629. It is based on paragraph 5(3) of 
Schedule 22 to FA 2008. 
 
Disposals for consideration not fully recognised by accounting practice: disposals 
before 16 May 2008 
3572. This paragraph preserves the commencement rules applying on the 
introduction of the source legislation for clause 698. It is based on paragraph 4(3) of 
Schedule 22 to FA 2008. 
 
References to Companies Act 2006 
3573. This paragraph provides for the interpretation of references to section 286 of 
the Companies Act 2006 until such time as that section is brought into force. It is 
based on regulation 6 of The Corporation Tax (Implementation of the Mergers 
Directive) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/1579). 
 
3574. The paragraph applies the equivalent provision in the predecessor Companies 
Act until an order brings section 658 of the Companies Act 2006 into force. 
Repeal of provisions concerning exchange gains and losses from derivative 
contracts 
3575. This paragraph preserves the prospective repeal by F(No 2)A 2005 of some 
provisions dealing with exchange gains and losses. It is based on paragraph 9(1) of 
Schedule 6 to F(No 2)A 2005. 
 
Part 14: Other relief for employee share acquisitions 
Accounting periods beginning before 1 January 2003 
3576. This paragraph preserves the transitional provision in paragraph 33 of 
Schedule 23 to FA 2003. This transitional might be required to prevent a double 
deduction in the case of an option granted before 1 January 2003 but exercised 
after 30 March 2009. 
 
Part 17: Film production 
Application of Part 15 etc to films that commenced principal photography before 1 
January 2007 but were not completed before that date 
3577. Section 52 of FA 2006 contains powers to make transitional provisions 
relating to films that started principal photography before 1 January 2007 but which 
were not completed before that date. The Corporation Tax (Taxation of Films) 
(Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/1050) have been made under 
section 52 of FA 2006. 
 
3578. Some of the tax provisions which are modified, for transitional purposes, by 
SI 2007/1050 are rewritten in Part 15 but others (such as the withdrawal of existing 
film reliefs for both income tax and corporation tax purposes) are not rewritten or are, 
effectively, rewritten elsewhere (in the Part dealing with intangible fixed assets). 
 
3579. These paragraphs adapt the transitional provisions in SI 2007/1050 so that they 
refer to the appropriate places in FA 2006, Part 15 of this Bill or elsewhere in this 
Bill. 
 
Part 19: Unremittable income 
Unremittable income that arose in an accounting period ending before 1 April 2009 
3580. This paragraph ensures that the relief given by Part 18 of this Bill, and any 
withdrawal of that relief by virtue of clause 1276 or 1277, is not restricted to income 
that arose in an accounting period ending on or after 1 April 2009 or, as regards 
withdrawal of relief, to claims under that Part. 
 
3581. See also sub-paragraph (7) of the paragraph headed &#8220;tribunal reform&#8221; in 
Part 21 of this Schedule. 

 
Part 21: Other provisions 
Miscellaneous profits and losses: apportionment to accounting periods ending 
before 1 April 2009 
3582. Clause 1307 applies to various sources of income that are taxed under 
Schedule D Case VI in the source legislation. It rewrites section 72 of ICTA which 
allows the profits of a period of account to be apportioned. 
 
3583. The basis of assessment for such income is the full amount of the profit arising 
in the accounting period (clause 8). If accounts are prepared for any of these sources it 
may be necessary to apportion the profits of accounts made up to a period which is 
not itself an accounting period to arrive at the figure of profit that arises in each 
relevant accounting period. 
 
3584. Clause 1329 provides that the Bill when enacted takes effect for corporation 
tax purposes for accounting periods ending after 31 March 2009. This paragraph 
provides that the rewritten legislation applies to a period of account that straddles 1 
April 2009 even though an accounting period or periods ending before 1 April 2009 
are affected. This Bill includes a number of minor changes in the law. Without this 
paragraph it would be necessary for taxpayers to take account of those changes only 
for the accounting period ending on or after 1 April 2009. 
 
3585. If the taxpayer does not want the new law to apply to a transaction that 
occurred before 1 April 2009 it can elect for the old legislation to continue to apply 
(see Part 2 of this Schedule). 
 
Charge to tax under Case VI of Schedule D in subordinate legislation 
3586. These paragraphs preserve the effect of references to Schedule D Case VI in 
subordinate legislation. Where a provision such as section 396 of ICTA refers to 
something &#34;within the charge to corporation tax under Case VI of Schedule D&#34;, that 
reference is sufficient to pick up any such part of the charge as is applied in secondary 
legislation. For an example of this, see paragraph 58 of the Authorised Investment 
Funds (Tax) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/964). 
 
3587. Such references to Schedule D Case VI are replaced by references to 
provisions in the table in section 834A of ICTA (which is inserted by Schedule 1 to 
this Bill). The first paragraph ensures that such parts of the charge to corporation tax 
that are in secondary legislation are treated as within the table in that section. The 
second paragraph ensures that any such secondary legislation that had effect for the 
purposes of loss relief in respect of a transaction to which Schedule D Case VI applied 
continues to have equivalent effect. 
 
Tribunal reform 
3588. This paragraph makes provision for a number of rules to apply by reference to 
the functions of General or Special Commissioners until those functions are 
transferred to the First-tier Tribunal or Upper Tribunal in accordance with an order 
made under section 30 (1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. 
3589. A draft of such an order (&#8220;the Transfer of Tribunal Functions and Revenue and 
Customs Appeals Order 2008&#8221;) has been laid before Parliament for approval by 
resolution of each House of Parliament in accordance with section 49(5) of the 
Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The order proposes the transfer of the 
functions of the General Commissioners and Special Commissioners to the First-tier 
Tribunal or Upper Tribunal by means of amendments of references to General 
Commissioners and Special Commissioners in primary and secondary legislation. It 
also proposes the repeal of various provisions including sections 31B to 31D of TMA 
and section 584(9) of ICTA as well as the insertion of appropriate replacement 
appellate procedures where needed. The draft order proposes coming into force on 1 
April 2009. 
 
3590. The drafting of the Bill assumes the proposals in the draft order will be in 
force on 1 April 2009, the date on which the Bill itself comes into force. This 
paragraph preserves the position under the law as it stood before that date, for the 
clauses rewriting provisions that refer to procedures before General or Special 
Commissioners, in the event that the draft order comes into force later than 1 
April 2009. It also preserves a transitional rule, under which the right of appeal to the 
Special Commissioners, in section 584(9) of ICTA, is retained for cases involving 
questions on the operation of that section or Part 18 of the Bill that refer to income 
arising in an accounting period ending before 1 April 2009. See Change 98 in 
Annex 1.

FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE BILL 
 
3594. The Bill will not require any additions to previously planned expenditure. 
Revision of guidance for users and for staff will be undertaken as part and parcel of 
the process of improving such material and keeping it up to date in response to new 
legislation and other changes. The minor changes in the law in the Bill are expected to 
have negligible effect on tax revenues. 
 
EFFECTS OF THE BILL ON PUBLIC SERVICE MANPOWER 
 
3595. The Bill will not require any increase in the number of staff in HMRC or other 
departments. 
SUMMARY OF THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
 
3596. An implementation stage impact assessment of the effects of the Bill is 
available at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/index.htm#full or from Jackie Bartlett, Tax Law 
Rewrite Project, HMRC, 8th Floor, SW Wing, Bush House, Strand, London WC2B 
4RD (Telephone 020 7438 7606). 
 
3597. In summary, the Bill is expected to benefit companies, external tax 
professionals and agents as well as HMRC staff. The benefits are broadly summarised 
as: 
 
    &#8226; greater ease of use of the legislation with fewer disputes or errors concerning 
       the meaning of the law; and 
 
    &#8226; less time spent navigating, understanding and applying the legislation 
       correctly. 
 
3598. In addition: 
 
    &#8226; tax professionals new to the legislation will find it easier to understand and 
       learn; and 
 
    &#8226; greater ease of use of the legislation will result in lower costs. 
 
3599. There will be some one-off costs to business: there will be retraining costs for 
users in familiarising themselves with the new legislation and commercial publishers 
and software suppliers will need to update their products. 
 
EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
3600. Section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the Minister in charge of a 
Bill in either House of Parliament to make a statement, before second reading, about 
the compatibility of the provisions of the Bill with the Convention rights (as defined 
in section 1 of that Act). 
 
3601. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has made the following statement: 
 
    In my view the provisions of the Corporation Tax Bill are compatible with the Convention rights. 
 
3602. The provisions of the Bill have been the subject of careful consideration in 
order to ensure that they are compatible with the Convention rights. The following 
provisions have received closest scrutiny. Articles referred to below are Articles of the 
Convention. 
Clause 245 
3603. This clause provides that an officer of HMRC may by notice require a person, 
thought by the officer to have information about the effective duration of a lease, to 
provide information on matters specified in the notice. In relation to a solicitor acting 
for a client, the scope of the information is limited to whether the solicitor was acting 
on behalf of the client and that client&#8217;s name and address. 
 
3604. The solicitor/client relationship is in principle protected by Article 8. 
Nevertheless, this clause has a legitimate aim and is a proportionate means of 
obtaining the information, since it is discretionary in nature and therefore allows the 
officer to use alternative, less intrusive means if available. It does not offend the limits 
of legal professional privilege, since it does not result in the disclosure of legal advice 
itself. It is therefore compatible with the Article 8 rights of both the taxpayer and the 
solicitor. 
 
Clauses 333, 334, 609 and 610 
3605. These clauses rewrite Paragraph 10A of Schedule 9 to FA 1996 (loan 
relationships) and Paragraph 22A of Schedule 26 to FA 2002 (derivative contracts). 
They apply where a United Kingdom resident company asset holder ceases to be 
resident or where the asset ceases to be held for the purposes of a permanent 
establishment in the United Kingdom. In either case the relevant event causes the 
asset to be taxed at fair (market) value. 
 
3606. The apparent difference in treatment, between resident and non-resident 
companies, does not engage Article 14 (in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol 1). 
There is no use of a personal characteristic as a ground for the difference in treatment. 
 
Clauses 792 and 793 
3607. These clauses rewrite part of Paragraph 66 of Schedule 29 to FA 2002, 
relating to intangible fixed assets. That paragraph allows the reallocation of a 
chargeable realisation gain (described in clause 741) between members of a group of 
companies, on certain conditions. The main condition is that the transferee company 
must be resident in the United Kingdom or trading through a permanent establishment 
not exempt from corporation tax under double taxation rules. 
 
3608. The apparent different treatment of non-resident group companies not trading 
here is not incompatible with Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination), taken in 
conjunction with Article 1 Protocol 1 (protection of property), because such a 
company is not in a comparable situation to resident group companies, not having the 
same economic connection with the United Kingdom. Nor is the difference in 
treatment based upon a personal characteristic. Further, in so far as the condition is 
intended to prevent reallocation of charges outside the United Kingdom tax net, it is 
an anti-avoidance provision which pursues a legitimate aim in a proportionate 
manner. 
Clause 1207 
3609. The offence created in this clause consists of unlawful disclosure of private 
taxpayer information by officials acting for the Secretary of State for Culture, Media 
and Sport and officials of the United Kingdom Film Council. A defence is available if 
the official shows that he or she reasonably believed that the disclosure was lawful or 
that the information was already available to the public. Disclosure is &#8220;lawful&#8221; if it is 
made in accordance with one of the six exceptions listed in clause 1206(3) (for 
example, if disclosure is authorised by an enactment, under an order of a court or with 
the consent of the person to whom the information relates). 
 
3610. The reverse onus in this provision does not offend the presumption of 
innocence in Article 6(2), since it does not remove the presumption, but merely allows 
a specific defence which, when weighed against the taxpayer confidentiality rights, is 
both appropriate and fair. 
 
Part 2 of Schedule 2 
3611. The Bill makes minor changes to the law in the interests of simplification and 
to bring the legislation into line with current practice. These changes have either no 
practical effect or only small effects. A small number may make small increases in the 
amount of tax payable for a small group of taxpayers. In addition, the wording of the 
Bill differs from the wording of the legislation it replaces in very many detailed 
particulars. Although the contents of the Bill have been examined with great care, it is 
still possible that some of these detailed changes will operate to change the law in 
ways that cannot now be foreseen. Some of the changes arising in this way may have 
effect so as to impose a charge to tax in respect of events occurring before the 
respective provisions have effect. 
 
3612. Part 2 of Schedule 2, therefore, addresses the possibility of an unfair adverse 
effect upon a taxpayer, and possibly upon the taxpayer&#8217;s Convention rights. A 
corresponding provision was included in ITA. If there is an action or event prior to the 
coming into force of the Bill which has certain tax consequences, and the effect of the 
Bill is that those tax consequences change when the Bill comes into force, the 
taxpayer may opt that the tax consequences after the Bill comes into force are to be 
the same as they were under the &#8220;old&#8221; law. While Article 1 of Protocol 1 is engaged, 
the provision satisfies the fair balance test in that Article. 
 
TERRITORIAL EXTENT 
 
3613. The Bill extends to the whole of the United Kingdom. 
 
3614. Because the Sewel Convention provides that Westminster will not normally 
legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the 
Scottish Parliament, if there are amendments relating to such matters which trigger the 
Convention, consent of the Scottish Parliament will be sought for them. 
COMMENCEMENT 
 
3615. The substantive provisions of this Bill will come into force on 1 April 2009. 
Clause 1329 provides for it to have effect: 
 
   &#8226; for corporation tax purposes, for accounting periods ending on or after that 
      day; and 
 
   &#8226; for income tax and capital gains tax purposes, for the tax year 2009-10 and 
      subsequent tax years.
