                   DIGITAL ECONOMY BILL [HL] 
                                   &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; 
 
                          EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1.       These Explanatory Notes relate to the Digital Economy Bill [HL] as introduced in the 
House of Lords on 19th November 2009. They have been prepared by the Department for 
Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in order to 
assist the reader of the Bill and to help inform debate on it. They do not form part of the Bill 
and have not been endorsed by Parliament. 
 
2.     The Notes need to be read in conjunction with the Bill. They are not, and are not 
meant to be, a comprehensive description of the Bill. So where a clause or part of a clause 
does not seem to require any explanation or comment, none is given. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
3.      The communications sector is one of the three largest economic sectors in the UK 
economy, accounting for around 8% of GDP. In recent times, this sector has undergone 
significant changes, shaped by the development and use of digital technologies by industry 
and consumers. 
 
4.      It was against this background that Digital Britain, the government&#8217;s investigation into 
this sector, was launched in autumn 2008. The government published the Digital Britain 
White Paper, entitled Digital Britain: Final Report (Cm 7650) in June 2009. The White 
Paper made a number of recommendations. The Digital Economy Bill takes forward those 
that require legislation. 
 
STRUCTURE OF THE BILL 
 
5.      The Bill comprises 49 clauses and three Schedules and covers eleven topics. 
 
6.      Topic 1 is the general duties of the Office of Communications (&#8220;OFCOM&#8221;). Clauses 1 
to 3 impose a new general duty on the communications regulator, OFCOM, to have particular 
regard, when performing their functions, to the need to: 
 
     &#8226; Promote investment in electronic communications networks; 
 
HL Bill 1&#8213;EN                                   1                                           54/5 
 
    &#8226; Promote investment in content that contributes to the fulfilment of specified public 
      service objectives; and 
 
    &#8226; Make sure the investment is efficient, wherever possible. 
 
7.     Clauses 1 to 3 also impose a new duty on OFCOM to provide to the Secretary of State 
a report on the UK communications infrastructure every two years, and to report on media 
content. 
 
8.     Topic 2 is online infringement of copyright. Clauses 4 to 17 impose on internet 
service providers obligations aimed at the reduction of online infringement of copyright. 
OFCOM is responsible for the specification of the procedural and enforcement aspects of 
these obligations through the approval or adoption of legally binding codes of practice. 
Clause 17 gives power to the Secretary of State to make provision by order to amend Part 1 or 
Part 7 of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 for the purpose of preventing or 
reducing on-line copyright infringement. 
 
9.      Topic 3 is powers in relation to internet domain registries. Clauses 18 to 20 provide 
that, where the Secretary of State has serious concerns about the operation of a register of 
internet domain names, the Secretary of State may take steps, or ask the court to take steps, 
relating to the management or constitution of the body operating the register. 
 
10.    Topic 4 is the Channel Four Television Corporation (&#8220;C4C&#8221;). Clauses 21 and 22 
extend C4C&#8217;s functions. 
 
11.    Topic 5 is independent television services. Clauses 23 to 29 update the statutory 
framework for the Channel 3 and Channel 5 licences to introduce more flexibility and to 
remove the requirement for Channel 3 licence holders to produce and broadcast Gaelic 
language programmes. Clause 28 confers a new power on OFCOM to appoint persons to 
provide regional and local news for Channel 3 areas, or parts of such areas. 
 
12.     Topic 6 is independent radio services. Clauses 30 to 36 introduce changes to the 
licensing regime for independent radio services to facilitate the change to digital services. 
 
13.    Topic 7 is regulation of television and radio services. Clause 37 provides for the 
Secretary of State to alter the conditions of public service provision that OFCOM must 
include in Channel 3 and 5 licences, with the option to change the conditions back at a later 
date. 
 
14.     Topic 8 is access to electromagnetic spectrum. Clauses 38 and 39 enable the 
reallocation of spectrum currently used by mobile network operators. 
15.    Topic 9 is video recordings. Clauses 40 and 41 and Schedule 1 implement changes to 
video games classification as recommended in Safer Children in a Digital World: Byron 
Review1, extending the range of video games that are subject to requirements to be age-rated 
and supplied only in accordance with the rating. 
 
16.    Topic 10 is copyright and performers&#8217; property rights: licensing and penalties. 
Clauses 42 and 43 and Schedule 2 amend the law on copyright licensing by: 
 
       &#8226; Giving the Secretary of State power to make provision by statutory instrument for the 
          regulation of copyright licensing to enable (a) the regulation of collecting societies, (b) 
          the conferral of extended powers on collecting societies to grant licences over works of 
          non-members, and (c) to make other provision for the granting of licences in respect of 
          orphan works; and 
 
       &#8226; Increasing penalties for some forms of copyright infringement. 
 
17.    Topic 11 is public lending right. Clause 44 amends the Public Lending Right Act 
1979 and the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to allow inclusion of non-print formats 
(audio-books and e-books) in the public lending right payment regime. 
 
TERRITORIAL EXTENT AND APPLICATION 
 
18.        The Bill extends to all of the United Kingdom. 
 
19.     Video games classification and public lending right are transferred matters in Northern 
Ireland. The Northern Ireland Assembly&#8217;s consent to the provisions on those topics is being 
sought. 
 
20.    There is no effect on the Welsh Ministers or the National Assembly for Wales and no 
other particular effect on Wales. 
 
21.     This Bill does not contain any provisions falling within the terms of the Sewel 
Convention. Because the Sewel Convention provides that Westminster will not normally 
legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the Scottish 
Parliament, if there are amendments relating to such matters which trigger the Convention, the 
consent of the Scottish Parliament will be sought for them.

COMMENTARY ON CLAUSES 
 
Topic 1: General duties of OFCOM 
Background 
22.     Section 3(1) of the Communications Act 2003 (&#8220;the 2003 Act&#8221;) provides that the 
principal duty of OFCOM, when exercising their functions, is to further the interests of 
citizens in relation to communications matters and to further the interests of consumers in 
relevant markets, where appropriate by promoting competition. Relevant markets are those for 
any of the services, facilities, apparatus or directories in relation to which OFCOM have 
functions. 
 
</TextSection><Clause Number="1" SerialNumber="2">Clause 1: General duties of OFCOM 
23.     This clause amends section 3 of the 2003 Act. It inserts a new subsection (1A) which 
provides that when performing their duties under subsection (1) OFCOM must have particular 
regard, in all cases, to the need to: 
 
    &#8226; Promote appropriate levels of investment in electronic communications networks; and 
 
    &#8226; Promote appropriate levels of investment in public service media content, which fulfils 
       the public service objectives specified in paragraphs (b) to (j) of section 264(6) of the 
       2003 Act. Examples of public service media content include content that reflects, 
       supports and stimulates cultural activity in the United Kingdom, and content that 
       facilitates fair and well-informed debates on news and current affairs. 
 
24.    Paragraph (c) of new subsection (1A) requires that OFCOM must have particular 
regard to the need for the investment to be efficient, wherever possible. It recognises that it 
may sometimes be necessary for OFCOM to promote investment that is not efficient. For 
example, investment in public service content may not always be efficient as this 
content serves a public policy as well as an economic objective. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="2 " SerialNumber="3">Clause 2 : OFCOM reports on infrastructure, internet domain names etc. 
25.     This clause inserts three new sections into the 2003 Act which will require OFCOM to 
report to the Secretary of State on the state of the UK&#8217;s communications infrastructure and 
services. 
 
26.    New section 134A requires OFCOM to produce an initial report in the first year after 
the provision comes into force, followed by subsequent reports at two-yearly intervals. It also 
requires that should OFCOM become aware of a marked change with a significant impact on 
business or the public, in any of the reporting areas, and which they consider should be 
brought to the attention of the Secretary of State, they should write a further report. 
 
27.     New section 134B sets out the subject matter to be covered by the reports. The initial 
report and the biennial reports will consist of a survey of: 
    &#8226; The different types of electronic communications network and service in the UK; 
 
    &#8226; Geographic and population coverage of those networks and services; 
 
    &#8226; Downtime, and measures in place to maintain or improve availability; 
 
    &#8226; Emergency planning; and 
 
    &#8226; A comparison between UK networks and services and equivalent networks and 
       services provided in a range of other countries. 
 
28.     Additionally, in relation to UK networks, the reports will cover infrastructure sharing 
(for example, where two or more mobile operators pool their network of masts and both offer 
services across them), capacity (the amount of data that networks and parts of networks are 
able to carry and the rate at which they can carry it) and wholesale arrangements (the extent to 
which one operator can buy capacity on another operator&#8217;s network and then sell it on to retail 
customers). In relation to services, they will also cover the use of the electromagnetic 
spectrum. 
 
29.     The clause also inserts a new section 134C into the 2003 Act which requires OFCOM 
to report on matters specified by the Secretary of State relating to internet domain names 
when requested to do so. These matters might include the management and distribution of 
internet domain names by registries and the misuse of domain names or the use of unfair 
practices by registries, end-users of domain names or their agents (known as registrars). 
 
30.     The reporting duty would, for example, enable the Secretary of State to ask OFCOM 
to report on the activities of internet domain registries based in the UK (and their registrars 
and end-users) in circumstances where the Secretary of State believes that the operation of 
those registries (or the activities of their registrars or end users) could adversely affect, or has 
already adversely affected, the reputation or operation of the UK&#8217;s internet economy and/or 
the interests of consumers or the public in the UK. 
 
31.     In addition, the clause amends section 135 of the 2003 Act to enable OFCOM to use 
their existing information gathering powers to require communications providers and others 
to supply the information which they will need to write their reports. Those powers are 
subject to the restrictions in section 137 on the imposition of information requirements, which 
means, in particular, that a demand for information must be proportionate to the use for which 
the information is to be put. Penalties for contravention of the information requirements may 
be imposed under section 139. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="3" SerialNumber="4">Clause 3: OFCOM reports on media content 
32.     Section 264 of the 2003 Act requires OFCOM to report at least every five years on the 
fulfilment of the public service remit for television by public service broadcasters, namely the 
BBC, Channel 4, S4C and providers of Channel 3 and Channel 5. The public service remit 
involves the provision of a balanced diversity of high quality content, which meets the needs 
and interests of different audiences in the United Kingdom. Paragraphs (b) to (j) of section 
264(6) of the 2003 Act provide detailed public service objectives underpinning this remit. 
According to these objectives, examples of public service media content would include 
content that reflects, supports and stimulates cultural activity in the United Kingdom, and 
content that facilitates fair and well informed debates on news and current affairs. 
 
33.     This clause extends the scope of OFCOM&#8217;s reviewing and reporting obligations 
beyond television. Under new section 264A, OFCOM will be required to consider the wider 
delivery of public service media content on other platforms, such as the internet and on- 
demand programme services, and review the extent to which such content contributes towards 
the fulfilment of the public service objectives defined in section 264(6)(b) to (j). 
 
Topic 2: Online infringement of copyright 
Background 
34.     The Bill includes provision concerned with online infringement of copyright. This is 
particularly, but not exclusively, in response to infringement of copyright in the fields of 
music, film and games. The provision inserts new sections 124A to 124M in the 
Communications Act 2003 (&#8220;the 2003 Act&#8221;), which impose obligations on internet service 
providers (&#8220;ISPs&#8221;) to: 
 
    &#8226; Notify their subscribers if the internet protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) addresses associated with them 
       are reported by copyright owners as being used to infringe copyright; and 
 
    &#8226; Keep track of the number of reports about each subscriber, and compile, on an 
       anonymous basis, a list of some or all of those who are reported on. After obtaining a 
       court order to obtain personal details, copyright owners will be able to take action 
       against those included in the list. 
 
35.     The obligations will be underpinned by a code approved by OFCOM or, if no industry 
code is put forward for approval, made by OFCOM. The code will set out in detail how the 
obligations must be met. 
 
36.     In case the initial obligations prove insufficient to reduce significantly the level of 
online infringement of copyright, the provisions also grant the Secretary of State a power to 
impose further obligations (&#8220;technical obligations&#8221;) on ISPs. These would be imposed on the 
basis of reports from OFCOM or any other relevant considerations, and would require ISPs to 
take measures to limit internet access to certain subscribers. The intention is that technical 
measures would be used against serious repeat infringers only. Technical measures would be 
likely to include bandwidth capping or shaping that would make it difficult for subscribers to 
continue file-sharing, but other measures may also be considered. If appropriate, temporary 
suspension of broadband connections could be considered. 
37.     OFCOM would be subject to an obligation to prepare a code setting out the procedural 
mechanisms to give effect to the technical obligations of ISPs. The technical measures were 
described more fully in the consultation document issued on 16th June 2009, as supplemented 
by the government statement published on 25th August 20092. 
 
38.    To safeguard the interests of consumers, the provisions also require appeals processes 
to be set up as part of the underpinning codes. These would include the right to appeal 
decisions of ISPs to impose technical measures. The appeal would be to a person independent 
of OFCOM, with a further right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. 
 
39.     The provisions also set out how the costs of operating such a system may be shared. 
Funding from cost apportionment would enable an underpinning code to be developed by 
interested parties. To illustrate how the provisions might work in practice, possible processes 
of notification and court action are outlined below: 
 
       &#8226; Copyright owners identify cases of infringement and send details including IP 
             addresses to ISPs; 
 
       &#8226; The ISPs verify that the evidence received meets the required standard, and link the 
             infringement to subscriber accounts; 
 
       &#8226; The ISPs send letters to subscribers identified as apparently infringing copyright. They 
             keep track of how often each subscriber is identified; 
 
       &#8226; If asked to do so by a relevant copyright owner, ISPs supply a serious infringers list 
             showing, for each subscriber who has been identified repeatedly by the copyright 
             owner, which of the copyright owner&#8217;s reports relate to that subscriber. The list does 
             not reveal any subscriber&#8217;s identity; 
 
       &#8226; Copyright owners use the serious infringers list as the basis for a large scale &#8220;Norwich 
             Pharmacal&#8221;3 court order to obtain the names and addresses of some or all of those on 
             the list. At no point are individuals&#8217; names or addresses passed from the ISP to a 
             copyright owner without a court order; 
 
    http://www.berr.gov.uk/consultations/page51696.html 
 
3 An equitable remedy taking its name from the order made in the case of Norwich Pharmacal Co. v Commissioners of Customs and Excise [1974] AC 133. A Norwich 
Pharmacal order requires a respondent to disclose certain documents or information to the applicant. The respondent must be a party who is involved or mixed up in a 
wrongdoing, whether innocently or not, and is unlikely to be a party to the potential proceedings. 
    &#8226; Copyright owners send &#8220;final warning&#8221; letters direct to infringers asking them to stop 
       online copyright infringement and giving them a clear warning of likely court action if 
       the warning is ignored; and 
 
    &#8226; Copyright owners take court action against those who ignore the final warning. 
 
40.     OFCOM will be under a duty to report regularly to the Secretary of State on the 
efficacy of the initial obligations in reducing the level of online copyright infringement. 
Taking those reports or any other relevant factors into account, the Secretary of State may 
direct OFCOM to assess whether, and if so which, technical measures against particular 
subscribers may be appropriate, and to report back to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of 
State may, on the basis of this report or any other consideration, make an order imposing on 
ISPs &#8220;technical obligations&#8221; to take measures against subscribers who meet certain criteria. 
The measures would be to limit the subscribers&#8217; internet access. 
 
41.     If the Secretary of State imposed technical obligations on ISPs, OFCOM would be 
required to make a code for the purpose of regulating the technical obligations, or to revise the 
existing code to take account of them. The new or revised code would need to comply with 
requirements relating to enforcement. For example, it would have to include rights for a 
subscriber to appeal against a technical measure that an ISP had taken or proposed to take, 
and would need to comply with requirements as to the reimbursement of costs. 
 
42.     The intention is that copyright owners would be held to the same standards of 
evidence of copyright infringement as for the initial obligations, and that the procedure for 
reporting infringement of copyright would be the same as well. 
 
43.     Clause 17 gives power to the Secretary of State to make provision by order to amend 
Part 1 or Part 7 of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 for the purpose of preventing 
or reducing on-line copyright infringement. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="4" SerialNumber="5">Clause 4: Obligation to notify subscribers of reported infringements 
44.     The section of the 2003 Act that is inserted by this clause (section 124A) sets out an 
obligation for ISPs to notify subscribers of copyright infringement reports (&#8220;CIRs&#8221;) received 
about them from copyright owners. It describes what CIRs and notifications to subscribers 
must contain, the procedures that copyright owners must comply with when making CIRs, 
and the procedures that ISPs must follow when sending subscriber notifications. 
 
45.     Copyright owners are currently able to go on-line, look for material to which they 
hold the copyright and identify unauthorised sources for that material. They can then seek to 
download a copy of that material and in doing so capture information about the source 
including the IP address along with a date and time stamp. However, at present they do not 
have the ability to match this information to the broadband subscriber to whom that IP 
address was allocated at that precise time. This information is only held by the subscriber&#8217;s 
ISP. Therefore, the copyright owner relies on the ISP&#8217;s ability to match the IP address to the 
name and address of the subscriber concerned. 
 
46.     However, the ISP is unable to pass this information on to the copyright owner without 
a court order. To do so would breach data protection and privacy law. To help ensure that the 
subscriber is made aware that their account appears to have been used to breach copyright, 
section 124A imposes an initial obligation on the ISP, in relevant cases, to notify the 
subscriber if the ISP receives a CIR from a copyright owner. 
 
47.     The notification from the ISP must inform the subscriber that the account appears to 
have been used to infringe copyright, and it must provide evidence of the apparent 
infringement, direct the consumer towards legal sources of content, and provide other advice. 
The code may require the notification to include other material as well, such as a statement 
that information about the apparent infringement may be kept and disclosed to the copyright 
owner in certain circumstances. Further apparent infringements using the subscriber&#8217;s account 
may result in additional notifications. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="5" SerialNumber="6">Clause 5: Obligation to provide infringement lists to copyright owners 
48.     ISPs will have to keep a record of the number of CIRs linked to each subscriber along 
with a record of which copyright owner sent the report. Under section 124B of the 2003 Act, 
inserted by clause 5, an ISP may be required to provide a copyright owner with relevant parts 
of those records on request (&#8220;copyright infringement lists&#8221;), but in an anonymised form so as 
to ensure compliance with data protection legislation. The intention is for the code to set out a 
threshold number of CIRs, for example 50, which means that a subscriber will be considered a 
serious repeat infringer whose alleged infringements must be covered by any copyright 
infringement lists that the ISP provides to the relevant copyright owner. 
 
49.    A copyright infringement report represents a single breach of copyright at a moment in 
time. At present, a copyright owner has no way of knowing whether the subscriber behind 
that CIR habitually infringes copyright online or whether the CIR represents a curious 
individual trying file-sharing for the first and only time. Because of this, the high costs 
involved in legal action deter copyright owners from enforcing their rights. By allowing 
copyright owners to target only the most serious repeat infringers, copyright infringement lists 
provided by ISPs are intended to make legal action a more attractive and effective tool for 
copyright owners to use in respect of their copyright. 
 
50.     The lists would be made available to copyright owners on request in an anonymised 
form. For example, while a list might (for example) identify subscriber 936 as being linked to 
the most CIRs, it would not include any personal information about subscriber 936. In order 
to get this personal data, the copyright owner would need a court order. However, the list 
would allow the copyright owner to identify subscriber 936 as someone against whom legal 
action may be appropriate. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="6" SerialNumber="7">Clause 6: Approval of code about the initial obligations 
51.     The obligations provided for in new sections 124A and 124B would not have effect 
until there was a complementary code in force that had been approved or made by OFCOM. 
 
52.      Clause 6 inserts new section 124C in the 2003 Act. This section sets out the 
requirements for OFCOM&#8217;s approval of a code regulating matters in connection with the 
initial obligations. The process by which infringements are detected, the standard of evidence 
that the copyright owner must meet before an ISP must send a notification letter, the format of 
CIRs, and the routes of appeal for consumers are all issues of detail that section 124C would 
require the code to deal with. The government hopes that all stakeholders (ISPs, copyright 
owners and consumers) will contribute to the development of an industry code. Other criteria 
that an approved industry code may specify include setting in advance the number of CIRs the 
ISPs will be expected to process in a given period (say, six months). 
 
53.     Without these criteria, there would be no obligation for copyright owners to provide 
infringement information in a standard format and no protection for ISPs in the event that 
copyright owners set extremely high levels of expected CIRs. 
 
54.    The government also envisages that any approved code would also set out the time a 
copyright owner has to submit a CIR (so that a CIR must relate to a recent infringement) and 
the time the ISP has to act on the CIR and send a notification to the subscriber (for example, 5 
working days). 
 
55.     The government&#8217;s intention is for the obligations to fall on all ISPs except those who 
are demonstrated to have a very low level of online infringement. This is on the basis that it 
would be disproportionate (in cost terms) to require an ISP to incur significant costs to 
counter a problem that does not exist to any significant degree on its network. The proposal is 
therefore for the code to set out qualifying threshold criteria, based on the number of CIRs an 
ISP receives in a set period of time. The government anticipates that most small and medium 
(&#8220;SME&#8221;) ISPs and, possibly, the mobile networks would fall under the threshold. However, 
this exemption would not be a one-off exercise and the qualifying period would be a rolling 
one (for example, &#8220;x&#8221; number of CIRs received in a rolling 3 month period). ISPs would need 
to ensure online infringement of copyright remained at a low level or else face the prospect of 
passing the qualifying threshold. Once in scope, ISPs would have to comply with the 
obligations and to continue to do so even if the number of CIRs later fell below the threshold. 
 
56.    In order to ensure that the code covered all the necessary areas and to a sufficient 
standard, OFCOM&#8217;s approval would be needed before it could come into force and the 
Secretary of State would need to consent to the approval. 
 
57.    Before approving a code, OFCOM would be expected to carry out consultation. Under 
sections 124C and 124E (which is inserted by clause 8), OFCOM would also need to satisfy 
themselves that the code was objectively justifiable, proportionate and transparent. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="7" SerialNumber="8">Clause 7: Initial obligations code by OFCOM in the absence of an approved code 
58.     Clause 7 inserts new section 124D in the 2003 Act. The new section provides for the 
making by OFCOM of a code regulating the initial obligations if there is no industry code. 
The government hopes industry can devise a satisfactory code which OFCOM approves. 
However, if that does not happen, OFCOM must develop a code themselves for adoption by 
order. It is possible that stakeholders may be able to reach agreement on parts of the code, 
which OFCOM can then consider, and, if appropriate, include as part of OFCOM&#8217;s code. 
Again, the consent of the Secretary of State would be required for the making of the code. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="8" SerialNumber="9">Clause 8: Contents of the initial obligations code 
59.    Clause 8 inserts new section 124E in the 2003 Act. This sets out what the code 
underpinning the initial obligations (whether an industry code or OFCOM&#8217;s own code) must 
contain. The reason for including the underpinning material in a code, rather than directly in 
the 2003 Act, is that it is likely to be detailed and to have to be adapted and refined over time. 
 
60.      The code must set out the process by which the initial obligations will operate and the 
procedures that copyright owners and ISPs must follow in relation to them. It must set out the 
criteria, evidence and standards of evidence required in a CIR and the required format and 
content of a notification letter sent to a subscriber. It must set out the enforcement procedures 
that OFCOM or a body set up by OFCOM to administer the code may employ in the event of 
a failure to comply with the code. And it must also specify the rights of subscribers to 
challenge actions under the legislation by the ISPs and copyright owners. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="9" SerialNumber="10">Clause 9: Progress reports 
61.    Clause 9 inserts new section 124F in the 2003 Act. Section 124F places an obligation 
on OFCOM to prepare full reports (every 12 months) and interim reports (every 3 months) 
about the infringement of copyright by subscribers to internet access services. Each report 
must be sent to the Secretary of State as soon as practicable after the end of the period for 
which is prepared. 
 
62.     These reports will help the Secretary of State to monitor trends in online copyright 
infringement and to ascertain the effectiveness of the obligations on ISPs. As part of the 
reports OFCOM will, for the first time, be required to produce assessments of the level of 
online infringement of copyright. The reports will also take account of various factors which 
might affect the level of online copyright infringement, such as the steps taken by copyright 
owners to enable subscribers to obtain lawful access to copyright works, and the extent to 
which copyright owners are making CIRs and following up with legal action against 
subscribers. They are intended to be a source of information that the Secretary of State can 
draw on when taking decisions about whether to impose additional obligations on ISPs. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="10" SerialNumber="11">Clause 10: Obligations to limit internet access: assessment and preparation 
63.    New section 124G of the 2003 Act, inserted by clause 10, confers a power on the 
Secretary of State to direct OFCOM to assess whether ISPs should be obliged to take 
technical measures against certain subscribers, or direct OFCOM to take steps to prepare for 
technical obligations. In particular, OFCOM may be required to carry out a consultation or 
assess the likely efficacy of different kinds of technical measure, and to report back to the 
Secretary of State. Technology used for the purposes of online infringement of copyright is 
changing fast and it is not possible at this stage to know which technical measures would be 
effective. 
 
64.     The government&#8217;s aim is for the initial obligations in new sections 124A and 124B to 
significantly reduce online infringement of copyright. However, in case the initial obligations 
prove not as effective as expected, new section 124H gives the Secretary of State the power to 
introduce further obligations, should that prove appropriate. 
 
65.    OFCOM would be required to set out supporting provision in a technical obligations 
code under section 124I (which is inserted by clause 12). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="11" SerialNumber="12">Clause 11: Obligations to limit internet access 
66.    New section 124H of the 2003 Act is inserted by clause 11 and gives the Secretary of 
State power to order ISPs to impose technical measures on internet access service subscribers 
meeting certain criteria. 
 
67.      The government envisages that the criteria for taking a technical measure against a 
particular subscriber would be the same as the criteria used to determine whether the 
subscriber&#8217;s alleged infringements are included in a copyright infringement list under the 
initial obligations. So a technical measure would be applied if a subscriber had been linked to 
a number of CIRs sufficient to place them on a serious infringers list. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="12" SerialNumber="13">Clause 12: Code by OFCOM about obligations to limit internet access 
68.     If the Secretary of State makes an order under section 124H requiring ISPs to take 
technical measures against subscribers, OFCOM will be under an obligation to adopt (by 
order) a code underpinning the technical obligations. This is provided for in new section 124I 
of the 2003 Act, inserted by clause 12. 
 
69.    Section 124I sets out the procedure for the making by OFCOM of the code on 
technical obligations. It also provides that the Secretary of State&#8217;s approval of the code is 
required before it can be made. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="13" SerialNumber="14">Clause 13: Contents of code about obligations to limit internet access 
70.    Clause 13 inserts new section 124J in the 2003 Act. Section 124J sets out a list of 
matters which are to be included in the technical obligations code. Thus the code must, for 
example, include provision in relation to enforcement. The code would have to provide 
subscribers with a right to challenge the imposition of a technical measure. Also, under the 
code, if there was a legal challenge by a subscriber, the taking of the measure could be 
postponed until the person hearing the challenge or (on appeal) the First- tier Tribunal had 
resolved the appeal. 
71.    The code could provide for OFCOM to set up bodies in charge of administering the 
code and hearing appeals from subscribers. 
 
72.    The government envisages that the code would also set out the process by which a 
technical measure would be taken, and the information that would have to be sent to a 
subscriber facing such a measure. It would also address how any costs might be apportioned, 
and set out the dispute mechanism in the event of disagreement between an ISP and a 
copyright owner. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="14" SerialNumber="15">Clause 14: Enforcement of obligations 
73.     Clause 14 inserts new section 124K in the 2003 Act. Section 124K sets out the 
penalties which may be imposed on an ISP for the contravention of their initial obligations or 
obligations to impose technical measures, or of the obligation to provide assistance to 
OFCOM under section 124G. 
 
74.    The maximum penalty is specified as the sum of &#163;250,000. However, the Secretary of 
State has a power to increase this amount by order. The order would be subject to the 
affirmative resolution Parliamentary procedure. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="15" SerialNumber="16">Clause 15: Sharing of costs 
75.    The initial obligations and any later technical obligations will give rise to costs. These 
will include the cost to ISPs of processing copyright infringement reports and issuing 
subscriber notifications, the costs to ISPs associated with the imposition of any technical 
measures, OFCOM&#8217;s costs in approving or preparing the codes, the cost of enforcing them, 
and the funding of any subscriber appeals to an independent appeals body or the First-tier 
Tribunal. 
 
76.     New section 124L of the 2003 Act, inserted by clause 15, confers a power on the 
Secretary of State to specify by order provision which must be included in the codes and 
which sets out how costs are to be apportioned between copyright owners and ISPs. The costs 
are those incurred under the copyright infringement provisions. The purpose of the section is 
to help ensure that the parties carry out their obligations in an efficient and effective manner 
and that both ISPs and copyright owners have economic incentives to take action to reduce 
online infringement of copyright through commercial agreements. 
 
77.    The government believes that most of the costs of subscriber appeals to an 
independent person determining appeals or the First-tier Tribunal should be funded by 
industry, so that a subscriber does not face significant costs in making an appeal. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="17" SerialNumber="17">Clause 17: Power to amend copyright provisions 
78.    Clause 17 inserts a new section 302A into the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 
1988 (&#8220;the 1988 Act&#8221;). It enables the Secretary of State to make provision by order to amend 
Part 1 or Part 7 of the 1988 Act for the purpose of preventing or reducing on-line copyright 
infringement. The power may only be exercised if it appears to the Secretary of State 
appropriate to do so having regard to technological developments that have occurred or are 
likely to occur. 
 
79.     In addition to the problems caused by services such as unlawful peer-to-peer (P2P) 
file-sharing and other many-to-many infringements which are dealt with by other provisions 
of the Bill, cyber lockers (on-line data repositories) and similar services have also been 
identified as areas where damaging online copyright infringements are already occurring and 
where the problem could grow rapidly. The government&#8217;s concern is that in a rapidly moving 
technological environment a response that is more flexible than relying on new primary 
legislation is required in order to meet technological evolution. 
 
80.      The power may be exercised to: 
 
      &#8226; Confer, modify or remove a power, right or duty; and 
 
      &#8226; Require a person to pay fees. 
 
81.      The order made under this provision is to be: 
 
      &#8226; Made by statutory instrument; 
 
      &#8226; Subject to approval by resolution of each House of Parliament; and 
 
      &#8226; Subject to the requirement that it is made after consultation of persons likely to be 
        affected by the order or their representatives, as the Secretary of State thinks fit. 
 
82.     The use of the power is restricted by the requirement for prior consultation and by the 
affirmative resolution procedure, which requires Parliament&#8217;s approval for any order before it 
may be made. It is also limited so as not to allow the Secretary of State to create or modify 
any criminal offence. Illustrative examples of the possible ways in which this power could be 
used include: adapting the legal process (including for example section 97A of the 1988 Act) 
to allow rights holders to take more effective action more quickly against websites hosting or 
sharing material in breach of copyright; creating a fast track process; or imposing a duty on a 
body to report on the prevalence of new or emerging types of online infringement. 
 
Topic 3: Powers in relation to internet domain names 
Background 
83.    The Bill gives powers to the Secretary of State to intervene in the operation of domain 
name registries. Such registries allocate internet domain names to end users. Internet domain 
names (such as www.google.co.uk) underpin the addressing system for the internet. 
84.     The Bill confers powers exercisable in circumstances where there has been misuse of 
domain names, or the use of unfair practices by registries, registrars and end-users of domain 
names, or where registries have failed adequately to deal with complaints. The powers are 
only exercisable where those failures have adversely affected or are likely adversely to affect 
(a) the reputation or availability of electronic communications services or networks in the UK 
and/or (b) the interests of consumers or members of the public in the UK. The provisions only 
affect registries which take the form of companies formed and registered under the 
Companies Act 2006 or limited liability partnerships. 
 
85.    The powers allow the Secretary of State to appoint a manager of a registry or to apply 
to court to intervene in relation to a registry&#8217;s constitution in order to secure that the registry 
remedies specified serious failures (and any consequences of them). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="18" SerialNumber="18">Clause 18: Powers in relation to internet domain registries 
86.     This clause amends the Communications Act 2003 (&#8220;the 2003 Act&#8221;) by inserting a 
new section 124N. The section applies where the Secretary of State wishes to use the new 
powers set out in clauses 19 and 20 and is satisfied that there has been a serious failure of a 
registry because: 
 
    &#8226; The registry itself, its end-users (that is, owners of or applicants for domain names) or 
       registrars (that is, agents of end-users) have been engaging in practices prescribed in 
       regulations made by the Secretary of State which are unfair or which involve the 
       misuse of internet domain names; or 
 
    &#8226; The registry&#8217;s arrangements for dealing with complaints in connection with domain 
       names do not comply with requirements prescribed in regulations made by the 
       Secretary of State. 
 
87.     Possible examples of unfair practices would be cyber-squatting (that is, registering 
domain names which are of economic value to other people and then charging those people 
high prices to buy them or use them for their own purposes); drop-catching (that is, waiting 
until the expiry date for an existing registered domain name, snatching it and then charging 
the previous owner to buy it back); or pressure sales tactics. 
 
88.     Possible examples of the misuse of internet domain names would be registering 
intentionally misleading domain names, perhaps using them for phishing (a form of internet 
fraud); distributing malware or spyware, which are computer viruses; spamming; intentionally 
misleading the public into believing there is a connection between the domain name owner 
and other organisations (or that another organisation owns or authorises the use of the domain 
name). 
 
89.     The section provides that such a failure will be serious where it has adversely affected 
or is likely adversely to affect the reputation or availability of electronic communications 
networks or services provided in the UK, or the interests of consumers or the public in the 
UK. 
 
90.     Where the section applies, the Secretary of State must notify the registry specifying 
the failure and a period within which the registry may make representations to the Secretary 
of State. In practice, the Secretary of State may (if he considers it appropriate in the 
circumstances) require OFCOM to prepare a report on the allocation, registration and/or 
misuse of internet domain names by UK-based registries under section 134C (inserted by 
clause 2(1)) before exercising his powers. 
 
91.    New section 124N defines internet domain registry and other terms used in these 
provisions. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="19" SerialNumber="19">Clause 19: Appointment of manager of internet domain registry 
92.    This clause amends the 2003 Act by inserting new sections 124O and 124P. If the 
Secretary of State has served a notice under new section 124N, the period allowed for making 
representations has expired and the Secretary of State is satisfied that the registry has not 
taken appropriate steps to remedy the failure or its consequences, the Secretary of State may 
appoint a manager in respect of the property and affairs of the registry to secure that 
appropriate steps are taken to remedy the failure or the consequences of the failure. 
 
93.     New clause 124P makes provision about the powers and functions of the manager so 
appointed. In particular, the Secretary of State may provide for the manager to take over any 
or all specified functions of the directors in order to ensure that the registry remedies the 
failure or the consequences of it, and may also prevent the registry&#8217;s directors from carrying 
out those functions (subsection (2)). The Secretary of State may also provide for the 
remuneration of the manager, which may be payable by the registry itself (subsection (3)). In 
order to ensure that this power does not affect the rights of third parties or the insolvency 
process, section 124O(4) provides that the appointment does not affect the rights of any third 
party to appoint a receiver or manager, or the rights of any receiver or manager appointed by a 
third party. For similar reasons, section 124O(6) provides that if certain office holders under 
insolvency legislation are appointed in respect of the registry, the Secretary of State must 
discharge the order appointing a manager. The Secretary of State must also keep the order 
under review and discharge it if appropriate, for example if the registry has remedied the 
failure (section 124O(5)). 
 
94.    Section 124P(5) to (7) allow the Secretary of State to seek directions from a court in 
connection with the manager&#8217;s functions. This might be done in order to counter obstruction 
of the manager by a registry or its officers, since disobeying the court&#8217;s directions would 
amount to contempt. 
 
95.    Section 124P(8) applies all the provisions to limited liability partnerships as if the 
references to a director were to a member of the limited liability partnership. 
96.     Subsection (2) of clause 19 inserts a reference to an order under section 124O into 
section 192(1)(d) of the 2003 Act. The effect of this is that the registry has a right of appeal 
on both the facts and the law to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (and thence to the Court of 
Appeal on a point of law) in respect of a decision to appoint a manager. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="20" SerialNumber="20">Clause 20: Application to court to alter constitution of internet domain registry 
97.     This clause amends the 2003 Act by inserting a new section 124Q. This gives the 
Secretary of State the power to apply to the court for an order to alter the constitution of a 
registry and to limit the registry&#8217;s ability to amend its constitution itself without the leave of 
the court. The provision only applies where the Secretary of State has served a notice under 
new section 124N, the period allowed for making representations has expired and the 
Secretary of State is satisfied that the registry has not taken the appropriate steps to remedy 
the failure or its consequences. The court may only make an order if the court considers it is 
appropriate in order to secure that the registry remedies the failure specified in the section 
124N notification and any consequences of that failure. Section 124Q(5) provides that, in the 
case of a company, the constitution means the articles of association, and in the case of a 
limited liability partnership, it means the limited liability partnership agreement (as defined). 
The Secretary of State may exercise his power under this section to apply to court to alter the 
constitution and the power under new section 124O to appoint a manager concurrently (if he 
considers it appropriate). 
 
Topic 4: Channel 4 Television Corporation 
Background 
98.    C4C&#8217;s existing primary functions currently relate only to the Channel 4 television 
channel. Taking into account the growth of digital media, the Bill introduces provisions that 
extend the functions of C4C in relation to media content. The Bill achieves this by 
introducing new C4C functions via a new section 198A of the Communications Act 2003 
(&#8220;the 2003 Act&#8221;). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="21" SerialNumber="21">Clause 21: Functions of C4C in relation to media content 
99.     This clause will require C4C to participate in the making of a broad range of high- 
quality content that appeals to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society, and 
broadcast or distribute such content on a range of different delivery platforms. This content 
must include news and current affairs, content for older children and young adults and feature 
films. C4C will also be required to participate in the making of high quality films. To 
&#8220;participate&#8221; in this way includes investing in or otherwise procuring content. For the 
avoidance of doubt, these new duties on C4C to make content do not disapply the condition in 
Channel 4&#8217;s regulatory regime, referred to in section 295 of the 2003 Act, requiring C4C not 
to be involved, except to such extent as OFCOM may allow, in the making of programmes to 
be broadcast on Channel 4. 
100. The clause also makes provision as to the wider aims C4C must pursue in performing 
their duties, drawing on the core public purposes that C4C identified in their March 2008 
report Next on 44. C4C must support new talent and innovation, support and stimulate well- 
informed debate, promote alternative views and perspectives and help to inspire change in 
people&#8217;s lives. 
 
101. The clause also requires C4C, in the performance of their duties, to have regard to the 
desirability of: 
 
       &#8226; Working with cultural organisations; 
 
       &#8226; Encouraging innovation in methods of content delivery; and 
 
       &#8226; Promoting access to and awareness of services provided in digital form. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="22" SerialNumber="22">Clause 22: Monitoring and enforcing C4C&#8217;s media content duties 
102. This clause contains provision for monitoring and enforcing the delivery of C4C&#8217;s 
new functions, through new sections 198B, 198C and 198D of the 2003 Act. This 
complements, and is in part modelled on, the existing accountability framework for the 
delivery of the public service remit of the Channel 4 licensed public service television 
channel, under section 266 of the 2003 Act. 
 
103. New section 198B requires C4C to prepare, every year, a statement of media content 
policy, setting out how C4C propose to discharge their functions in the coming year. The 
statement must also report on their performance against the proposals contained in the 
previous year&#8217;s statement. 
 
104. In preparing this statement, C4C will be obliged to have regard to guidance issued by 
OFCOM and also to consult OFCOM. It will be open to C4C to produce the statement of 
media content policy either as a separate document or as part of a single document in 
combination with the statement of programme policy which it is required to provide in 
relation to the Channel 4 service. 
 
105. OFCOM will be required to keep their guidance under review and revise it as they 
think fit. 
 
106. New section 198C gives OFCOM a new obligation to review and report on the 
performance of C4C&#8217;s new duties, which may well include the making and broadcasting of 
 
    Available at: http://www.channel4.com/about4/next_on4.html 
programmes on television, at the same time as their reviews of the fulfilment of the public 
service remit under section 264 of the 2003 Act. 
 
107. New section 198D introduces enforcement powers for OFCOM in relation to the 
fulfilment by C4C of their new functions. It creates a new power of direction for OFCOM in 
the event that C4C fail to perform their new duties under new section 198A or to prepare or 
publish a statement of media content policy. The new section gives OFCOM the power to 
direct C4C to revise their latest statement of media content policy, to take such steps to 
remedy the failure as OFCOM may prescribe in the direction, or both. OFCOM must include 
in any direction a reasonable timetable for complying with it and state the factors OFCOM 
will take into account in determining whether or not a failure has been remedied. OFCOM 
must consult C4C before issuing such a direction. By virtue of sections 41(1) and (6) of the 
Broadcasting Act 1990, OFCOM have the power to impose a financial penalty on C4C for a 
failure to comply with a direction given by OFCOM under section 198D. 
 
108. This clause introduces, by means of a new section 271A of the 2003 Act, an additional 
power for OFCOM exercisable in the event that C4C fail to comply with a direction relating 
to a failure to perform one or more duties under section 198A. OFCOM must be satisfied that 
C4C are still failing to perform the relevant duty or duties and, if OFCOM are satisfied that it 
is reasonable and proportionate to the seriousness of the failure, they have the power to vary 
the licence under which the Channel 4 television service is licensed. OFCOM may vary the 
licence by making or adding such conditions to the licence as they consider appropriate to 
remedy C4C&#8217;s failure to perform the relevant new duties under section 198A. If, 
subsequently, OFCOM conclude that any of the new conditions are no longer required, they 
may vary the licence again, from such time as they determine. OFCOM must consult C4C 
before exercising the power to make or add conditions to the Channel 4 licence. 
 
Topic 5: Independent television services 
Background 
109. In the Digital Britain: Final Report, the government accepted OFCOM&#8217;s analysis that 
the value of the existing commercially-owned public service broadcasting Channel 3 licences 
will decline further between now and the completion of digital switchover and that the 
regulatory obligations attached to the licences will therefore require further review over the 
period. Clauses 23 to 29 make amendments to provisions contained in the Broadcasting Act 
1990 (&#8220;the 1990 Act&#8221;) and the Communications Act 2003 (&#8220;the 2003 Act&#8221;) in order to 
introduce additional flexibility into the licence processes for the commercially funded public 
service television broadcasters. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="23" SerialNumber="23">Clause 23: Determination of Channel 3 licence areas 
110. Section 14(2) of the 1990 Act requires OFCOM to structure the Channel 3 licence 
map on a regional basis. However, section 14(7) of the 1990 Act provides a caveat 
preventing OFCOM from constructing a licence area from either the whole of England or the 
whole of Scotland. 
111. This clause repeals section 14(7) of the 1990 Act to remove that restriction. At the 
same time, it inserts new section 14(7A), which provides that there must always be at least 
one licence area wholly contained within Scotland. Section 287 of the 2003 Act will still 
allow OFCOM to insert conditions in a licence to require the holder of a nationwide licence to 
provide regional programmes. 
 
112. The clause also inserts a new section 216A in the 2003 Act, allowing OFCOM to 
renew Channel 3 licences for a larger or smaller area than the area to which they relate before 
renewal. However, this power can only be exercised with the consent of the existing licence 
holders for the areas concerned. 
 
113. As a consequence of new section 216A, the clause amends section 216 to give 
OFCOM the power not to renew a licence if the area to which it relates is or will be covered 
entirely by another Channel 3 licence or licences which OFCOM have renewed or propose to 
renew. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="24" SerialNumber="24">Clause 24: Initial expiry date for Channel 3 and 5 and public teletext licences 
114. Section 224(2) of the 2003 Act provides the Secretary of State with the power, by 
order, to postpone the initial expiry date of licences to provide Channel 3 services, the licence 
to provide Channel 5, and the licence to provide the public teletext service. This clause 
amends section 224(2) to provide that different initial expiry dates may be set for those three 
different types of licence. 
 
115. Section 224(3) of the 2003 Act currently prevents the Secretary of State from 
exercising the power to postpone the initial expiry date if digital switchover is set to occur 
before 1st July 2013. The clause repeals section 224(3) and therefore gives the Secretary of 
State more flexibility to extend the duration of licences where appropriate. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="26" SerialNumber="25">Clause 26: Report by OFCOM on public teletext service 
116. Section 218(1) of the 2003 Act currently places a duty on OFCOM to do all they can 
to secure the provision of a national teletext service. 
 
117. Clause 26 inserts a new section 218A into the 2003 Act that places a duty on OFCOM 
to prepare a report on the viability of the public teletext service. The clause stipulates the 
assessments that OFCOM must include in the report. OFCOM must submit this report to the 
Secretary of State, and prepare and submit further reports when asked to do so by the 
Secretary of State. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="27" SerialNumber="26">Clause 27: Power to remove OFCOM&#8217;s duty to secure provision of public teletext 
service 
118. Clause 27 will remove OFCOM&#8217;s duty to do all that they can to licence someone to 
provide the public teletext service and replace it with a power to do so. 
119. This change will come into force on a day appointed by the Secretary of State by 
means of a statutory instrument, which must be approved by Parliament before it can take 
effect. The Secretary of State may only make this order if he is satisfied that it would be in the 
public interest, and that either condition A or B stipulated in clause 27 has been met. 
Condition A is that the Secretary of State has laid before Parliament a report prepared by 
OFCOM under section 218A of the 2003 Act (inserted by clause 26) on the viability of 
continuing the provision of the public teletext service. Condition B is that OFCOM, after 
inviting applications for the licence to provide the public teletext service, receives no 
applications by the closing date or considers that it could not award the licence to any of the 
applicants. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="28" SerialNumber="27">Clause 28: Appointed providers of regional or local news 
120. This clause inserts a new section 287A in the 2003 Act which confers a new function 
on OFCOM of appointing and funding providers of regional or local news (or both). The new 
section allows OFCOM to set criteria and conditions for the provision of this type of news 
service in return for funding. 
 
121. The new section gives OFCOM the power to include any conditions they think 
appropriate in the regulatory regime for a regional Channel 3 service, in order to secure that 
the service includes news programmes provided by the person appointed to provide news for 
all or part of that regional Channel 3 service area. 
 
122. OFCOM are required to publish the criteria that they intend to use when appointing a 
news provider and must consult the Secretary of State before so doing. 
 
123. The new section requires OFCOM to specify certain conditions relating to the terms of 
the appointment, including the term of the appointment and the area for which the provider is 
appointed. OFCOM may attach a number of other conditions to the appointment and may 
revoke an appointment at any time. In practice, revocation would take place where OFCOM 
considered a material breach of the appointment had occurred, and reasonable notice would 
be given to all parties affected. 
 
124. Other conditions that OFCOM may set include those relating to the distribution and 
sharing of the content produced. Specifically, the content may need to be provided to the 
national news provider on Channel 3 and may also be provided to other parties in a range of 
formats. Conditions may be set that encourage the provider to support or promote wider 
benefits to society in connection with the provision of news. For example, this might include 
commitments to media skills and training. OFCOM must consult the Secretary of State 
before setting conditions in connection with the appointment of, or the making of payments 
to, news providers. 

 
</Clause><Clause Number="29" SerialNumber="28">Clause 29: Broadcasting of programmes in Gaelic 
125. This clause repeals section 184 of the 1990 Act, which contains requirements for 
certain Channel 3 licensees in Scotland (currently STV) to show Gaelic language 
programmes. 
 
126. The repeal of section 184 will be commenced by order. A fixed date for 
commencement has not been set because, at present, not all viewers are able to access Gaelic 
language television other than through STV. However, it is anticipated that, post switchover, 
more Gaelic television will be available to more viewers on other platforms. The effect of that 
development might be that it would no longer be necessary to impose Gaelic language 
broadcasting requirements on Channel 3 licence holders (although they may choose to 
broadcast in Gaelic). 
 
Topic 6: Independent radio services 
Background 
127. The Bill provides for the regulatory framework necessary to facilitate the delivery of a 
digital switchover of radio services to Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), referred to in the 
Digital Britain: Final Report as a &#8220;Digital Radio Upgrade&#8221;. In particular, the provisions give 
powers to the Secretary of State to nominate a date for digital switchover and ensure that 
OFCOM have sufficient powers to provide for an orderly changeover on that date, 
particularly powers to: 
 
    &#8226; Terminate relevant analogue licences by the nominated date for digital switchover 
       without the licence holders&#8217; consent, subject to a minimum notice period of 2 years; 
 
    &#8226; Renew national and local analogue radio licences for up to a further 7 years so long as 
       licence holders also provide content in a digital service via a multiplex5; 
 
    &#8226; Allow approved local licences to be renewed by the nomination of a national DAB 
       service, providing that the analogue and digital services share at least 80% of their 
       content; and 
 
    &#8226; Allow for variation of the frequency or coverage area of a multiplex licence, with the 
       aim of improving the coverage of DAB. 
 
  A multiplex consists of a number of digital services, such as radio stations, bundled together and 
transmitted digitally on a single frequency in a given transmission area. 
128. The Bill reduces regulatory burdens by enabling local stations to share premises and 
administrative costs within an area approved by OFCOM. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="30" SerialNumber="29">Clause 30: Digital switchover 
129. Clause 30 allows the Secretary of State to give notice to OFCOM of a date by which 
digital switchover must occur for services specified in the notice. In making a decision to 
nominate a switchover date, the Secretary of State must take account of any reports by the 
BBC and OFCOM about the future of analogue broadcasting. 
 
130. The date for digital switchover is the date after which it will no longer be appropriate 
for the service in question to be broadcast in analogue form. 
 
131. The Secretary of State may nominate different switchover dates for different types of 
radio services and may withdraw a nomination of a switchover date. 
 
132. After a switchover date has been set, OFCOM are required to vary the licence periods 
of all licences for the services specified by the Secretary of State so that they end on or before 
that date. However, OFCOM cannot shorten the duration of a licence so that it would end 
less than 2 years from the date on which OFCOM give notice of the variation, unless the 
licence-holder consents. 
 
133.   OFCOM may not vary a licence period so that it ends after the switchover date. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="31" SerialNumber="30">Clause 31: Renewal of national radio licences 
134. Clause 31 allows the further renewal of national analogue licences for a period of up 
to seven years. All of these licences have already been granted a renewal of 12 years under 
the powers in section 103A of the Broadcasting Act 1990 (&#8220;the 1990 Act&#8221;). 
 
135. The procedure to be adopted for licence renewals under the new section 103B of the 
1990 Act is that set out in subsections (2) to (9), (11) and (12) of section 103A of that Act. 
However, within these subsections, the provisions which refer to a situation where a digital 
service is not yet on-air do not apply. This is because an applicant for a renewal under section 
103B will already be providing a national digital simulcast service under the conditions of the 
previous renewal. 
 
136. OFCOM must include a condition in renewed licences requiring licence holders to do 
all they can to provide a digital simulcast of their radio service throughout the renewal period. 
 
137. An application for renewal must be made no later than three months before the 
relevant date, as defined in the existing section 103A(11) of the 1990 Act. Normally, 
OFCOM must determine the relevant date at least one year in advance. Clause 31(3) allows 
OFCOM to set a relevant date of less than one year after the date of determination where they 
consider that the relevant date falls no more than 15 months after the day on which clause 31 
comes into force. However, OFCOM must determine the relevant date as soon as practicable 
following commencement of clause 31. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="32" SerialNumber="31">Clause 32: Renewal and variation of local radio licences 
138. Clause 32 allows OFCOM to renew a local analogue licence for a period of up to 
seven years, provided it has already been renewed under section 104A of the 1990 Act or is 
granted on or after the date on which clause 32 comes into force. 
 
139. The procedure to be adopted for licence renewals under the new section 104AA is that 
set out in subsections (3) to (12), (13) and (14) of section 104A of the 1990 Act. 
 
140. Under current renewal conditions, the applicant for renewal of a local licence must 
nominate a local digital sound programme service and a local DAB multiplex. Sections 
104AA and 104AB make provision for holders of local licences to make a &#8220;national 
nomination&#8221;, that is, to nominate a national digital sound programme service and a national 
DAB multiplex. The power to make a national nomination is restricted to licences which are 
defined as an &#8220;approved licence&#8221;. It will be for OFCOM to determine, following 
consultation, whether a particular licence is approved for this purpose. The consultation 
requirement may be satisfied by OFCOM publishing a document before clause 32 comes into 
force. 
 
141. A national nomination must be made in the application for renewal or before OFCOM 
consider the application, and it may only be made where OFCOM are satisfied that the 
national digital sound programme service will include at least 80% of the content included in 
the service provided under the approved licence. 
 
142. Section 104AB(4) requires that, if a licence holder is to make an application under 
section 104AC in relation to other approved licences, such licences must be specified in the 
national nomination. 
 
143. The new section 104AC relates to a situation where an approved licence which has not 
yet been renewed under new section 104AA is specified in a national nomination made under 
new section 104AB(4) in connection with the renewal of another licence. It allows OFCOM 
to vary the approved licence, at the request of the licence-holder, by replacing the &#8220;local 
digital services condition&#8221; with a &#8220;national digital services condition&#8221;. 
 
144. A local digital services condition is a condition that OFCOM are currently required to 
include in renewed licences as a result of section 104A(12) of the 1990 Act, and by which a 
licence holder is required to do all the licence holder can to ensure that a local digital sound 
programme service is broadcast on a local radio multiplex service. The purpose of allowing 
such a condition to be replaced with a national digital services condition is so that holders of 
approved licences that have not yet been renewed under section 104AA but that wish to 
provide a digital service on a national multiplex, rather than on a local multiplex, are not, as a 
result, in breach of their local digital services condition. 
 
145. Before OFCOM vary a licence under this provision, they must be satisfied that the 
national digital sound programme service will include at least 80% of the content included in 
the service provided under the licence that is the subject of an application for variation. 
 
146. An application for renewal of a licence under section 104AA must be made no later 
than three months before the relevant date, as defined in the existing section 104A(13)(c) of 
the 1990 Act. Normally, OFCOM must determine the relevant date at least one year in 
advance. Clause 32(3) allows OFCOM to set a relevant date of less than one year after the 
date of determination where they consider that the relevant date falls no more than 15 months 
after the day on which clause 32 comes into force. However, OFCOM must determine the 
relevant date as soon as practicable following commencement of clause 32. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="33" SerialNumber="32">Clause 33: Variation of licence period following renewal 
147. This clause adds section 105A to the 1990 Act and allows the Secretary of State to 
reduce the duration of a licence renewed under section 103B or 104AA. This power only 
applies where the Secretary of State has not nominated a digital switchover date or has 
withdrawn a digital switchover date without nominating a further date. 
 
148. The Secretary of State may give notice to OFCOM of a termination date, specifying 
the services affected. Different termination dates may be given for different services, but the 
termination date cannot be before 31st December 2015. 
 
149. OFCOM are required to reduce the duration of a renewed licence so that it ends on or 
before the termination date set by the Secretary of State, but OFCOM cannot give less than 
two years&#8217; notice of termination of the licence, unless the licence-holder consents. 
 
150. OFCOM cannot vary the licence period under this section so that the licence expires 
after the termination date set by the Secretary of State. 
 
151. The Secretary of State must consider, before 31st December 2013, whether to exercise 
the powers contained in section 105A. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="34" SerialNumber="33">Clause 34: Content and character of local sound broadcasting services 
152. This clause allows OFCOM to amend the conditions of a local licence to allow local 
programming to be made outside of the licensed area and gives greater discretion to OFCOM 
to determine the appropriate level of locally-made content. 
 
153. OFCOM may agree to a departure from the character of a service provided under a 
local licence if programmes will continue to be made within an area approved by them. 
OFCOM must consult prior to approving an area or withdrawing their approval. The 
consultation requirement can be satisfied by OFCOM publishing a document before clause 34 
comes into force. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="35" SerialNumber="34">Clause 35: Local radio multiplex services: frequency and licensed area 
154. This clause inserts section 54A into the Broadcasting Act 1996 (&#8220;the 1996 Act&#8221;). It 
allows OFCOM to vary the frequency, or extend or reduce the coverage area, of a local radio 
multiplex licence. 
 
155. It is up to the holder of a licence to apply to OFCOM for approval of a variation. In so 
doing, the licence holder must submit a technical plan which indicates the proposed coverage 
area, the timetable and the technical means for implementing the change. OFCOM must 
consult on the proposal before granting the application, and they may only grant approval if 
they consider that the variation will not unacceptably narrow the range of local DAB 
programmes in the area for which the local radio multiplex is provided. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="36" SerialNumber="35">Clause 36: Renewal of radio multiplex licences 
156. Clause 36 contains a power to amend Part 2 of the 1996 Act (and, in particular, section 
58) by regulations for the purpose of making further provision about the renewal of radio 
multiplex licences. In particular, regulations made under this power may make provision 
about the circumstances in which OFCOM may renew a licence, the period of such renewal, 
the information that OFCOM may require from an applicant, the requirements that an 
applicant must meet, the grounds for refusal of an application, payments to be made and 
further conditions that may be included in a renewed licence. 
 
157. The power, which is exercisable until 31st December 2015, is subject to the 
affirmative procedure, requiring approval by both Houses of Parliament. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="37" SerialNumber="36">Topic 7: Regulation of television and radio services 
Clause 37: Application of regulatory regimes to broadcasters 
158. Section 263(4) of the Communications Act 2003 (&#8220;the 2003 Act&#8221;) gives the Secretary 
of State the power to cease to include certain obligations in the licence of any service. 
However, this power does not include any flexibility to remove obligations for a limited 
period or to reintroduce those if it is appropriate so to do. 
 
159. The clause amends section 263(4) to allow greater flexibility in response to market 
changes. The clause provides for the Secretary of State to alter the conditions of public 
service provision that OFCOM must include in Channel 3 and 5 licences, and then to change 
the conditions back at a later date. The Secretary of State may only make these alterations by 
affirmative order, which would require approval by Parliament before it could take effect. 
Topic 8: Access to electromagnetic spectrum 
Background 
160. Availability of next generation mobile broadband services requires the availability of 
spectrum. There are suitable blocks of spectrum either ready for allocation, or about to 
become available, namely spectrum at 2.6 Gigahertz (GHz) and 800 Megahertz (MHz) 
otherwise known as the Digital Dividend, available as a result of digital switchover. Attempts 
by OFCOM to bring this spectrum to market have, however, been subject to delay due to 
issues around spectrum used for delivery of second generation (2G) mobile services. 
 
161. These issues are complex and revolve around the change of use of spectrum at 
900MHz and 1800MHz, known as spectrum liberalisation. To date, the use of 900MHz 
spectrum has been constrained to providing 2G services through a European Directive 
87/372/EEC. This Directive has now been amended by Directive 2009/114/EC, to allow these 
spectrum holdings to be used for Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS, a 
3G mobile technology) and requires the UK to implement this change by May 2010. The 
revised Directive requires Member States to look at whether competitive distortion results 
from these changes. OFCOM&#8217;s view was that there was an issue and proposed the reallocation 
of some spectrum but OFCOM have been unable to agree with operators how this will be 
achieved. In parallel, the UK also has to implement a Radio Spectrum Committee Decision 
that allows the use of 1800MHz spectrum for UMTS. 
 
162. With little certainty on when this would be resolved, the government announced in the 
Digital Britain: Interim Report6 that it was seeking a solution, either through a voluntary 
industry consensus or an imposed government solution. An Independent Spectrum Broker 
was appointed to take this work forward. 
 
163. The Independent Spectrum Broker&#8217;s initial set of proposals were published on 13 
May7, and the government responded to these in the Digital Britain: Final Report8. Although 
the government stated that it was minded to implement the proposals, further work by the 
Independent Spectrum Broker was required. This work has now been completed, following 
extensive engagement with the mobile operators and other interested parties. 
 
164. The government is now considering the proposals with a view to making a final 
decision. It has become clearer during the latter phase of the Independent Spectrum Broker&#8217;s 
work that certain aspects of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (&#8220;the 2006 Act&#8221;) would need 
amending to implement some of the recommendations of the Independent Spectrum Broker.

    http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/broadcasting/6216.aspx 
165. The proposals put forward by the Independent Spectrum Broker require the 
application in certain cases of annual licence fees, including what is known as Administered 
Incentive Pricing, to spectrum that has been auctioned, including spectrum that has been 
relinquished by operators to conform to the spectrum caps referred to below and spectrum 
authorised for use by 3G licences extended from a fixed term to an indefinite term. 
 
166. Under the proposals put forward by the Independent Spectrum Broker, a set of 
temporary spectrum caps will be put in place during the auction and for a limited period after 
to prevent any one person holding more than a specified amount of spectrum. Operators may 
therefore be in a position of having to relinquish spectrum in order to comply with these caps 
and the relinquished spectrum will be auctioned. 
 
167. Where operators are required to relinquish spectrum in order to comply with 
temporary spectrum caps, time limits will be set for that release of spectrum within the 
wireless telegraphy licence conditions. It is important that this release happens in the 
timeframe set out to ensure effective competition is maintained. Licensees will also be subject 
to certain retail service and wholesale access obligations, in order to widen access to the 
spectrum. OFCOM&#8217;s existing powers to revoke or prosecute for breach of a wireless 
telegraphy licence condition may be disproportionate or insufficiently flexible to enforce the 
conditions which are proposed pursuant to a direction under section 5 of the 2006 Act to 
allow the timely reform of the spectrum. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="38" SerialNumber="37">Clause 38: Payment for licences 
168. Subsections (1) to (3) of this clause allow OFCOM to make regulations under section 
12(1)(b) of the 2006 Act which apply charges payable during the term of the licence to 
specified cases of wireless telegraphy licences allocated by auction. Section 12(5) of the 2006 
Act, which includes power to impose charges payable during the term of the licence, does not 
apply to a licence that has been allocated through auction. 
 
169. Subsections (4) to (7) of this clause allow OFCOM, with the consent of the Secretary 
of State, to make regulations under section 14(1) of the 2006 Act which will permit or require 
licences to which the regulations apply to provide for payments between operators in relation 
to licences auctioned under section 14 of the 2006 Act. 
 
170. Under existing legislation, payments for spectrum at auction are made to OFCOM 
who must pay them into the Consolidated Fund. Under the Independent Spectrum Broker&#8217;s 
proposals, the proceeds from any 2.1GHz relinquished spectrum should go back to the 
operator who relinquished it, on the basis that they bought this at auction in 2000. There will 
also be additional payments between operators arising from the auction of other relinquished 
spectrum. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="39" SerialNumber="38">Clause 39: Enforcement of licence terms etc 
171. This clause inserts a new section 43A into the 2006 Act giving OFCOM power to 
impose financial penalties for contravention of certain licence provisions, terms or limitations 
to which section 43A applies by virtue of a licence provision. A provision applying section 
43A can only be included in a licence if it appears to OFCOM that a direction of the Secretary 
of State made under section 5 of the 2006 Act requires OFCOM to include a particular 
provision, term or limitation in the licence. 
 
172.    Under the current legislation, OFCOM&#8217;s powers in respect of breaches of wireless 
telegraphy licences are limited to prosecution where such breach amounts to an offence under 
Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the 2006 Act or to revocation of the licence. 
 
173. OFCOM has power under sections 42-44 of the 2006 Act to impose financial penalties 
for contraventions of the terms, provisions or limitations of a general multiplex licence. 
 
Topic 9: Video Recordings 
Background 
174. The Video Recordings Act 1984 (&#8220;the 1984 Act&#8221;) makes it an offence to supply a 
video recording, such as a DVD, containing a video work, such as a film or video game, 
unless the video work has been submitted to an authority designated by the Secretary of State 
for classification as to its suitability to be viewed by persons of particular ages and the DVD 
is supplied in accordance with the classification certificate. The Secretary of State has 
designated principal office holders in the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for this 
purpose. Certain types of video works are exempted (see section 2 of the 1984 Act). They 
include video works that are designed to inform, educate or instruct, or that are concerned 
with sport, religion or music, provided that they do not contain specified types of content, 
such as sexual activity or gross violence. 
 
175. Most video games are currently exempted from the 1984 Act, unless they contain 
content such as sexual activity, gross violence or other matters of concern listed in section 
2(2) and (3) of the Act. The BBFC classify video games which contain any film material, 
because the film material is not usually exempt from the requirements of the 1984 Act, even 
when it is contained in an exempt game. Additionally, on a voluntary basis, the video games 
industry submits to the BBFC games which they believe are likely to be classified as 18+. 
 
176. Video games which are currently exempted under the 1984 Act are usually classified 
on a voluntary basis by the Pan-European Games Information (PEGI) system. PEGI 
classifications of 12 and over are administered throughout Europe by a UK body, the Video 
Standards Council (VSC). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="40" SerialNumber="39">Clause 40: Classification of video games, etc 
177. The Bill will extend the statutory classification requirement to video games that are 
only suitable for viewing by persons aged 12 years and above. This extension of the 
classification requirement to a wider age bracket for video games will implement Professor 
Tanya Byron&#8217;s recommendation set out in her independent review entitled Safer Children in a 
Digital World 9and it follows in the wake of a UK-wide public consultation on the future 
structure of the video game classification system. 
 
178. Clause 40 sets out the conditions that must be satisfied for the game to be an exempted 
work under the 1984 Act. The existing statutory exemptions for video games will continue to 
apply. So those games that, taken as a whole, are designed to inform, educate or instruct, and 
those concerned with sport, religion or music, will not be required to be classified, provided 
that they do not depict human sexual activity, gross violence or any of the other matters set 
out in section 2(2) and (3) of the 1984 Act. 
 
179. A video game will also be exempted if it satisfies one or more the conditions set out in 
new section 2A. The first condition is that the game does not contain anything listed in 
section 2A(2)(a) to (h). The second condition is that the designated authority (or a person 
nominated by it) has confirmed in writing that the game is suitable for viewing by persons 
under the age of 12. The criteria listed in section 2A(2)(a) to (h) are based on the criteria used 
by the PEGI10 system to determine whether a video game is only suitable for those aged 12 
years and above. They include depictions of violence against human or animal characters, 
depictions of activity involving illegal drugs, swearing and offensive language. Depictions of 
violence against human or animal characters would not meet the criteria if the character was 
of a rudimentary form, such as a simple stick character. 
 
180. The Secretary of State would have power to amend the criteria set out in section 
2A(2)(a) to (h) by regulations, subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. This would 
enable the criteria to be updated, if necessary, in the future, subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. 
The Secretary of State would also have power, by regulations subject to the affirmative 
resolution procedure, to add or remove further criteria for exempted video games. 
 
181. Section 3 of the 1984 Act sets out the circumstances in which a supply of a video 
recording is an exempted supply, even if the film or game contained in the video recording is 
not exempted. The Bill amends that section to secure that the supply of video games by 
means of amusement arcade machines is exempted (see new subsections (8A) and (8B)), 
unless the game includes any of the matters mentioned in section 2(2) and (3) of the 1984 Act. 
It also confers on the Secretary of State a new power to amend section 3 of the 1984 Act, by 
regulations subject to the affirmative procedure, by adding, varying or removing exempted 
supplies under the Act.

</Clause><Clause Number="41" SerialNumber="40">Clause 41: Designated authority for video games 
182. This clause inserts a new section 4ZA into the 1984 Act and allows the Secretary of 
State to designate two different authorities under section 4 of the Act. So, a person (or 
persons) may be designated to make arrangements with respect to video games (&#8220;the video 
games authority&#8221;) and a different person or persons may be designated for making 
arrangements in respect of other video works (&#8220;the video works authority). 
 
183. Some mechanism is thought to be necessary to enable the designated authorities, 
where appropriate, to transfer work between them. New section 4ZB provides that where two 
authorities are designated under section 4, responsibility for classifying a class of video games 
may be allocated by the video games authority to the video works authority. This would allow 
the video games authority to allocate to the other authority responsibility for video games that 
are considered to be suitable only for supply in licensed sex shops. It also provides that the 
video games authority may allocate responsibility in relation to video games when they are 
supplied in a particular type of video recording &#8211; for example, responsibility might be 
transferred for video games that are supplied on the same disc as a film or within the same 
boxed set as a film. An example would be the basic games found on Blu-Ray discs. Once an 
allocation is made, the video works authority has responsibility for making arrangements in 
respect to the allocated works. 
 
184. An allocation must be made by notice and may only be made with the consent of the 
video works authority. It may only be withdrawn by notice and with consent. When making 
or withdrawing an allocation, the video games authority must have regard to any guidance 
issued by the Secretary of State. 
 
185. Any question as to which authority is responsible for making arrangements with 
respect to a class of video games may be determined conclusively by the video games 
authority. New section 4ZA(2) provides that references in the 1984 Act to the designated 
authority in relation to a particular video work will be to the authority designated to be 
responsible for making arrangements in relation to the video work, taking account of any 
allocation made by the video works authority under new section 4ZB. 
 
186. New section 4ZC relates to video works that are found within video games, for 
example, a film which can be viewed as part of the process of playing a game. Where the 
video work already has a classification certificate issued by the video works authority, it 
enables the video games authority to take account of that certificate. For video works that 
have not already received a classification certificate, it enables the video games authority to 
make arrangements to obtain and have regard to any subsequent determination made by the 
video works authority as to the suitability of all or part of the video work included in a video 
game. The video games authority must consult the video works authority with respect to the 
appropriateness of the arrangements that it makes for taking account of such matters. It must 
also have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State. 

 
</Clause><Schedule Number="1" SerialNumber="41">Schedule 1: Classification of video games etc &#8211; supplementary provision 
187. Schedule 1 makes further amendments of the 1984 Act. 
 
188. Section 4 of the 1984 Act makes provision about the arrangements to be made by the 
designated authority. Sections 4(1)(b)(i) and (ii) and 7 are to be amended to clarify that the 
arrangements may include provision for the revocation of classification certificates. 
 
189. A new subsection (1C) is to be inserted into section 4 so that arrangements made 
under this section may require a person seeking a classification certificate for a video work to 
agree to comply with a code of practice, such as the PEGI11 code of practice. That code 
includes provision relating to the labelling of video recordings. 
 
190. A new subsection (3A) is to be inserted into section 4 to ensure that, prior to making 
any designation under section 4, the Secretary of State must satisfy himself that adequate 
arrangements will be made for taking account of public opinion in the United Kingdom. This 
means that the designated authority must have an effective system to gauge public opinion 
and take account of it. 
 
191. Section 4(5) currently requires the Secretary of State to approve tariffs for fees to be 
charged by the designated authority in connection with the classification of video works. The 
Bill would amend this so that the designated authority simply has to consult the Secretary of 
State about the fees that it proposes to charge. 
 
192. A new subsection (6A) is to be inserted into section 4 to ensure that the designated 
authority complies with any guidance issued by the Secretary of State relating to 
arrangements made under that section. For example, the Secretary of State may provide 
guidance on administrative matters such as how records of classification certificates are to be 
kept and how appeal arrangements may be set up. New subsection (6B) makes it clear that the 
Secretary of State&#8217;s guidance is not to extend to the criteria to be taken into account in making 
individual classification decisions. Section 4A of the 1984 Act sets out the criteria to which 
special regard is to be given by the designated authority when making such decisions. 
 
193. New section 7A of the 1984 Act provides that classification certificates may be issued 
so as to have effect only for the purposes of a particular video recording. This enables video 
works to be classified by reference to the recording in which they are to be published. For 
example, a video game may be classified for the purposes only of its supply for use on a 
particular platform, such as Nintendo or Xbox. Section 7A(2) provides that, in such a case, the 
classification certificate can only be relied on for the supply of the video work for use on that 
platform and not for its supply more generally. 
 
     http://www.videostandards.org.uk 
194. The offences set out in the 1984 Act at sections 11 (supplying a video recording of 
classified work in breach of classification), 13 (supplying a video recording not complying 
with requirements as to labels, etc) and 14 (supplying a video recording containing false 
information as to classification) are amended to provide that an offence is not committed 
where the video work concerned is an exempted work or the defendant believed on reasonable 
grounds that the video work was an exempted work. For example, the defendant might 
believe, on reasonable grounds, that a video game has not been classified because it is suitable 
for viewing by persons aged under 12, having regard to the criteria set out in new section 
2A(2)(a) to (h). 
 
195. The offences under the 1984 Act relate to the supply, or possession for the purpose of 
supply, of a video recording that contains a video work. Section 22(2) of the 1984 Act 
provides that a video recording contains a video work if it contains information by means of 
which all or part of the video work can be produced. There is an exception to this: if a video 
work contains an extract of another video work (for example, a film that includes an extract 
from another film), the extract is not part of the work of which it is an extract but a part of the 
video work which contains the extract; and hence the video recording contains that video 
work including the extract. An increasing variety of video recordings are available, some of 
which contain a mixture of films and video games. New subsection (2A) of section 22 would 
provide a power for the Secretary of State to make provision about the circumstances in which 
a video recording does or does not contain a video work for the purposes of the 1984 Act. 
This would allow provision to be made to take account of new formats, such as where a video 
game contains a whole film within it or a film contains a game within it. 
 
Topic 10: Copyright and performers&#8217; property rights: licensing and penalties 
<Clause Number="42" SerialNumber="42">Clause 42: Extension and regulation of licensing of copyright and performers&#8217; rights 
196. This clause introduces powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations 
authorising the use of orphan works (defined in regulations) and extended licensing as well as 
the regulation of licensing bodies. Currently, some uses of a work without the consent of the 
copyright owner even where that owner cannot be identified or traced are an infringement of 
copyright. There are civil penalties for infringement and infringement can be a criminal 
offence if it takes place on a commercial basis. As a result, many orphan works, some of 
significant cultural value, are not used. 
 
197. The advent of digital media has increased the volume and speed at which material 
protected by copyright or performers&#8217; rights is created and disseminated in the United 
Kingdom. Extended licensing will allow a licensing body to act on behalf of those remaining 
rights holders who are not members of, and so are not represented by, the body once that body 
has been authorised to do so by the Secretary of State. This is intended to make the system of 
rights clearance simpler for those seeking to use works. 
 
198. Any licensing body authorised to operate extended licensing, or to license orphan 
works, or that is failing to self-regulate, will be subject to obligations to adopt a code of 
practice. 
199. The clause introduces four new sections into the Copyright, Designs and Patent Act 
1988 (&#8220;the 1988 Act&#8221;): 
 
       &#8226; Section 116A enables the Secretary of State to make regulations which will provide for 
          the authorisation of a licensing body or other person to use or to license the use of 
          orphan works. It also provides for regulations to define orphan works. Subsections (2) 
          to (5) of the section enable the Secretary of State to determine whether a licensing 
          body or other person meets the requirements for authorisation, and to provide for the 
          treatment of royalties and other sums paid for authorisation of the use of orphan works 
          and for the rights and obligations of any person if a works ceases to be an orphan 
          work. 
 
       &#8226; Section 116B enables the Secretary of State to make regulations to authorise a 
          licensing body to operate extended licensing of published works and to allow a rights 
          owner to exclude itself from such licensing by notice. Subsections (2) to (5) of section 
          116A apply also to regulations about extended licensing. 
 
       &#8226; Section 116C introduces Schedule A1 to the 1988 Act (inserted by subsection (2) of 
          the clause and Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Bill) which confers powers on the Secretary 
          of State to provide for codes of practice relating to licensing bodies and the regulation 
          of licensing bodies and other bodies authorised under sections 116A and 116B. 
 
       &#8226; Section 116D provides that section 116B and Schedule A1 do not apply in relation to 
          Crown copyright or Parliamentary copyright. It also makes general provision about 
          regulations under the provisions inserted by the clause, including provision about 
          parliamentary procedure for making regulations. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="43" SerialNumber="43">Clause 43: Increase of penalties relating to infringing articles or illicit recordings 
200. The Gowers Review of intellectual property12 recommended that the penalties for 
online copyright infringement under section 107 of the 1988 Act should be matched with 
those that apply for physical infringement, by increasing the maximum prison sentence. 
Section 107 of the 1988 Act currently restricts fines awarded on summary conviction for 
criminal infringement of copyright under section 107(4)(a) and 107(4A)(a) to the statutory 
maximum, which is &#163;5,000 in England and Wales and &#163;10,000 in Scotland. The clause 
increases the maximum fine that may be imposed for these offences to &#163;50,000. It also 
increases the maximum fine on summary conviction for making, importing, distributing or 
 
     Gowers review of Intellectual Property, 6 December 2006 
making available an illicit recording under section 198(5) or 198(5A) from the statutory 
maximum to &#163;50,000. 
 
</Clause></Schedule><Schedule Number="2" SerialNumber="44">Schedule 2: Licensing of copyright and performers&#8217; property rights 
201. The Schedule makes supplementary amendments to the Copyright, Designs and 
Patents Act 1988 (&#8220;the 1988 Act&#8221;) in connection with clause 42. 
 
202. Part 1 of Schedule 2 inserts Schedule A1 into the 1988 Act. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of 
Part 1 give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations requiring a licensing body to 
comply with a code of practice which complies with requirements set out in those regulations 
and to impose a code on any licensing body that fails to do so. Paragraph 2 provides that 
these powers can only be exercised for the purposes of provision made under section 116A, 
that is the authorisation of the use of orphan works or section 116B, that is the authorisation 
of extended licensing or where it appears to the Secretary of State that a licensing body&#8217;s 
system of self-regulation is failing. Paragraph 2 also enables provision to be made for the 
procedures to be followed before regulation is applied or ceases to apply. 
 
203. Paragraph 3 enables the Secretary of State to make regulations to provide for the 
consequences of the non-compliance with a code of practice or authorisation under section 
116A or 116B, including financial penalties and a right of appeal to the Copyright Tribunal. 
 
204.   Paragraph 4 makes provision for fees to be charged to licensing bodies for regulation. 
 
205. Part 2 of Schedule 2 inserts paragraphs 1A to 1D into Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act. 
These paragraphs contain provisions equivalent to sections 116A to 116D for performers&#8217; 
property rights and apply Schedule A1 in relation to those rights. 
 
Topic 11: Public Lending Right 
Background 
206. Clause 44 amends the Public Lending Right Act 1979 (&#8220;the 1979 Act&#8221;) and the 
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (&#8220;the 1988 Act&#8221;) to reflect the changing nature of 
book publishing and the increasing demand for the loan of books from public libraries in 
formats other than print. It does this by: 
 
    &#8226; Extending eligibility for public lending right (&#8220;PLR&#8221;) payments to the authors of 
       audio-books and e-books; 
 
    &#8226; Extending PLR to producers and narrators of books that are recorded as sound 
       recordings; and 
 
    &#8226; Protecting public libraries who lend the books from liability for breach of copyright or 
       breach of rights in performances. 
207. The clause does not extend PLR to works that are available for loan from public 
libraries but that do not consist mainly of written or spoken words or still pictures. For 
example, films, music recordings and computer games are not covered. Neither does the 
clause extend PLR to digital files downloaded outside library premises. 
 
208. Since its introduction in 1979, PLR has compensated authors for the potential loss in 
sales resulting from their works being freely available to borrow from public libraries. Under 
the current PLR scheme established by virtue of the 1979 Act translators, editors, compilers 
and illustrators are included (along with writers) in the definition of &#8216;author&#8217; and so are 
eligible for PLR payments. PLR is now recognised by European legislation (Directive 
2006/115/EC on rental right and lending right) as reflecting and protecting the exclusive 
lending and rental rights of holders of rights in print books. 
 
209. Authors, performers and producers of non-print books, such as audio-books and e- 
books, have rights conferred on them under the 1988 Act allowing them (or anyone to whom 
they have assigned their rights) to authorise or prohibit the lending of their work by public 
libraries. The law currently requires libraries to enter into individual contractual and financial 
arrangements with those rights holders for the lending of non-print books. 
 
210. It is the view of government that this requirement could be having an impact on the 
willingness of libraries to lend audio and e-books. It could also be resulting in libraries 
lending works in breach of the rights of authors and other rights holders. Clause 44 is 
designed to help simplify the current system of payment to rights holders, give a wider range 
of rights holders&#8217; protection under the PLR scheme, and support innovation in publishing and 
the creative industries. The government hopes that it will also increase non-print lending by 
encouraging authors to enter the non-print market. 
 
<Clause Number="44" SerialNumber="45">Clause 44: Public lending right 
211. This clause amends the definition of &#8220;book&#8221; in the Public Lending Right Act 1979. 
The 1979 Act pre-dated the advent of most audio and e-books and consequently use of the 
word &#8220;books&#8221; within it is interpreted as being limited to books in printed format. This clause 
extends the definition to works that are recorded as sound recordings, and works recorded 
electronically, so long as they consist mainly of written or spoken words or still pictures. As is 
already the case for printed books, it is intended that the PLR payment scheme established 
under the 1979 Act will not cover audio and e-books whose author is described as other than a 
natural person, or that are musical scores, Crown Copyright publications, newspapers, 
journals or periodicals, or that are not offered for sale to the public or do not have an 
international standard book number (&#8220;ISBN&#8221;). 
 
212. The clause also amends the definitions of &#8220;lending&#8221;, &#8220;loan&#8221; and &#8220;borrowed&#8221; in the 
1979 Act with the aim of capturing almost all cases in which a public library makes a book 
(whether in print or audio or e-book form) available to a member of the public for use away 
from the library for a limited period of time. The exception is where the book is 
communicated by means of electronic transmission to a place other than the library, for 
example where the library makes digital files available for remote downloading. In practice 
this exception is likely to apply to e-books for which a licensing agreement exists between the 
library and author or publisher under which incremental payment is made based on usage, 
rather than on individual units purchased on a once-and-for-all basis. 
 
213. The clause amends the definition of &#8220;author&#8221; in the 1979 Act. Producers and narrators 
of audio-books and of e-books recorded as sound recordings play a role in making works in 
audio formats new and unique creations, not just different formats of the same printed 
volume. Like authors, producers and narrators are conferred with lending rights under the 
1988 Act: copyright in the case of producers and performers&#8217; rights in the case of narrators. 
This clause extends eligibility for PLR to those additional categories of rights holder. 
 
214. PLR as extended by the clause continues to be available to all rights holders primarily 
resident within the European Economic Area (EEA). The clause also preserves the lending 
rights of non-EEA rights holders under the 1988 Act so that they remain able to license or 
assign their rights to public libraries (and other persons) independently. 
 
215. The clause makes consequential amendments of the 1988 Act to reflect the extended 
definitions of &#8220;book&#8221;, &#8220;author&#8221; and &#8220;lending&#8221; in the 1979 Act. The amendments reduce the 
scope of copyright and rights in performances under the 1988 Act. This is to protect public 
libraries from liability under that Act when they lend works that are eligible for PLR. As a 
result of the changes, libraries will generally no longer need to make agreements with authors 
before lending out their e-books and audio-books. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="45" SerialNumber="46">General clauses 
Clause 45: Power to make consequential provision etc. 
216. This clause gives the Secretary of State the power to make incidental, supplementary, 
consequential, transitional, transitory or saving provision in connection with the amendments 
to various enactments made by the Bill. Certain necessary consequential amendments have 
already been identified and are included in the Bill. This power allows any further 
amendments to be made, where necessary, in order to give proper effect to the provisions 
made by the Bill. 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="46" SerialNumber="47">Clause 46: Repeals 
217. This clause introduces Schedule 3 which contains repeals of provisions of the Public 
Lending Right Act 1979 (c.10), Video Recordings Act 1984 (c.39), Broadcasting Act 1990 
(c.42) and Communications Act 2003 (c.21). 
 
</Clause><Clause Number="47" SerialNumber="48">Clause 47: Extent 
218. This clause provides that the Bill extends to England and Wales, Scotland and 
Northern Ireland. Subsection (2) provides that any amendments made by this Bill to the Acts 
listed in subsection (2) may be extended to any of the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man 
under relevant extending powers in those Acts. Subsection (4) permits amendments made by 
this Bill to Part 1 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to be extended to any 
British overseas territory under section 157(2) of that Act. 
 
FINANCIAL EFFECTS AND PUBLIC SECTOR MANPOWER 
 
219. There are two areas where there are potential effects on public expenditure and public 
service manpower: public lending right and effects on OFCOM. 
 
220. The Public Lending Right Registrar distributes DCMS grant in aid (&#8220;GiA&#8221;) to authors 
as PLR payments. Expanding PLR to cover books in non-print formats will require an 
ongoing commitment to provide additional GiA of an estimated &#163;0.75 million per year. 
 
221. The Bill also includes a number of provisions which make changes to OFCOM&#39;s 
activities and duties. It is expected that the additional duties the Bill places on OFCOM, and 
any associated increase in staffing, can be carried out within OFCOM&#39;s existing expenditure 
cap. The new local and regional news activity (clause 28) will be financed through a new 
source of funding additional to the existing funding cap. Further information about long-term 
funding can be found in The Government&#8217;s response to the consultation on &#8220;Sustainable 
independent and impartial news in the Nations, locally and in the regions&#8221; 13. 
 
SUMMARY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
 
222.       A package of impact assessments has been published. This includes: 
 
       &#8226; An overarching impact assessment which summarises the overall monetised and non- 
           monetised costs and benefits for the Bill as a whole; 
 
       &#8226; An equalities impact assessment for the Bill as a whole; and 
 
       &#8226; Specific impact assessments for each of the policy areas the Bill covers, including 
           specific impact tests and equalities assessments. 
 
223. Copies have been placed in the Vote Office of the House of Commons and the Printed 
Paper Office of the House of Lords. In addition, the full impact assessment is available on the 
BIS website: http://www.bis.gov.uk/digitaleconomybill 
 
     http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/publications/6431.aspx 
224. The Bill brings forward a number of specific policy proposals, decisions and 
recommendations across several substantive policy areas. The rationale for these different 
proposals, and the respective costs and benefits of these measures, are summarised in the 
overarching impact assessment, and discussed in detail in the individual impact assessments. 
There is not an aggregated cost/benefit analysis. 
 
225.   Key monetised and non-monetised costs include: 
 
    &#8226; Potential costs to consumers and businesses if the changes to OFCOM&#8217;s general duties 
       were to result in reduced clarity about OFCOM&#8217;s remit; 
 
    &#8226; Costs of implementation of the online copyright infringement provisions, estimated to 
       be in the region of &#163;290 to &#163;500 million, with the possibility of higher costs to 
       broadband consumers; 
 
    &#8226; Potential compliance costs to members of internet domain registries should they have 
       to comply with a request from the Secretary of State; 
 
    &#8226; One-off costs for the implementation of the news provisions. These will need to be 
       determined; 
 
    &#8226; A small loss to producers of Gaelic programming; and 
 
    &#8226; Due to the extension of the radio licence renewal regime, a loss to Government of 
       around &#163;10 million where it might have raised funds via the &#8220;blind auction&#8221;. The 
       regime will also reduce opportunities to enter the analogue commercial industry, 
       therefore potentially reducing competition. 
 
226.   Key monetised and non-monetised benefits are likely to arise as follows: 
 
    &#8226; Changes to OFCOM&#8217;s general duties are likely to improve OFCOM&#8217;s ability to further 
       citizens&#8217; and consumers&#8217; interests through promoting greater and accelerated 
       investment by network operators and in UK public service content; 
 
    &#8226; The online copyright infringement provisions will bring benefits to rights-holders by 
       recovering displaced sales (estimated benefit &#163;1700 million); 
 
    &#8226; The provisions on internet domain names are expected to benefit consumers by giving 
       greater protection in terms of reduced exposure to risk of financial loss and less 
       distress associated with mistakenly accessing a (fake) site similar to the one they were 
       intending to access, and the availability of better delineated disputes procedure; 
    &#8226; By allowing flexibility around licence obligations, the provisions on public service 
       broadcasting should ensure that the costs of licences reflect their true market value. 
       This should allow licence holders to make cost savings based on short term variations 
       to public service obligations; 
 
    &#8226; Co-location changes introduced by the provisions on independent radio services are 
       expected to allow cost savings and economies of scale. Large stations could see profits 
       before interest and tax rise from six per cent to 24 per cent assuming a ten per cent fall 
       in advertising revenue or from six per cent to seven per cent assuming a 20 per cent 
       fall in revenue; 
 
    &#8226; Provisions on extended collective licensing are not themselves expected to bring 
       monetised benefits. However, anecdotal evidence suggests an estimated reduction in 
       administration costs of two to five per cent. Provisions on matched penalties may bring 
       indirect benefits to business through a reduction in pirated goods and an increase in 
       legal sales of their products; 
 
    &#8226; Provisions on public lending right could bring benefits to rights holders in non-print 
       books of up to &#163;750,000 in additional payments. 
 
CARBON ASSESSMENT 
 
227.   The Bill will not have a significant impact on the environment or carbon emissions. 
 
COMPATIBILITY WITH THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
228. Section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the Minister in charge of a Bill in 
either House of Parliament to make a statement about the compatibility of the provisions of 
the Bill with the Convention rights (as defined by section 1 of that Act). 
 
229.   Lord Mandelson has made the following statement: 
 
&#8220;In my view the provisions of the Digital Economy Bill [HL] are compatible with the 
Convention rights.&#8221; 
 
230. All of the provisions of the Bill have been considered in relation to compatibility with 
the European Convention on Human Rights and other international human rights obligations. 
Only those clauses which raise potential compatibility issues are discussed below. In relation 
to the remainder of the clauses, there are no rights potentially engaged. 
Topic 1: General duties of OFCOM 
Power for OFCOM to require information from network providers (clause 2) 
231. Article 8 of the Convention is potentially engaged but that would depend on the 
circumstances and use of the power. It is possible that some of the information which will be 
required to be provided may constitute commercially confidential information. Such 
information supplied by network providers is capable of being information which would 
engage Article 8. 
 
232. However, OFCOM are a public authority for the purposes of section 6 of the Human 
Rights Act 1998 and must therefore exercise any power compatibly with Convention rights. 
In addition, section 137 of the Communications Act 2003 provides that any request for 
information must be proportionate to the use to which the information is to be put. The 
information to be provided by network providers is necessary to enable OFCOM to fulfil their 
new reporting duties under this clause in relation to the capability and resilience of the 
communications infrastructure and internet domain names. Section 393 of the 
Communications Act 2003 places restrictions on the disclosure of information obtained under 
powers conferred by that Act. It is therefore considered that conferring this power on OFCOM 
does not constitute a breach of Article 8 rights. 
 
Topic 2: Online infringement of copyright (clauses 4-17) 
Notification provisions 
233. Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention are 
potentially engaged by these measures. The Bill will place requirements on internet service 
providers (&#8220;ISPs&#8221;) to comply with two initial obligations; to send notifications to subscribers 
who have been identified by copyright owners in relation to alleged infringements of 
copyright; and to maintain internal lists of the number of times an individual subscriber has 
been identified and provide certain (non-identifying) information from those lists to affected 
copyright owners on request. 
 
Additional technical measures 
234. The Secretary of State will have the power by order to impose obligations on ISPs to 
take technical measures against internet subscribers. Such measures may include temporary 
suspension, bandwidth capping and bandwidth shaping. OFCOM will adopt a code of practice 
setting out procedures to enable ISPs to give effect to these measures. 
 
235. When following any rules specified by the Secretary of State or OFCOM for giving 
effect to the technical measures, ISPs will potentially be hindering subscribers from accessing 
the internet (and hence their e-correspondence), or from having the broadband connection 
speed and content they contracted for. These measures may amount to interferences with the 
right to respect for private life, the right to freedom of expression and the right to peaceful 
possession of property. The rights are engaged because affecting the ability of a subscriber to 
access the internet at a given speed or, potentially, at all will tend to affect their ability to 
communicate with others by on-line methods (by email, and through instant messaging and 
contributions to internet discussions). This would tend to affect their private and family life in 
the widest sense, but also Article 10 rights to freedom of expression and freedom of 
information. 
 
236. However, such interference does not render the provisions incompatible with the 
Convention. The provision represents an acceptable balance between subscribers&#8217; rights and 
the public interest in the protection of the copyright of third parties. Copyright owners have 
limited methods of protecting their copyright, which may be less effective across national 
boundaries than within a single jurisdiction. Infringement over the internet is likely to cross 
national boundaries. Moreover, subscribers may be infringing the rights of more than one 
copyright owner at a time, and these provisions permit action benefiting many copyright 
owner. By providing for a warning to subscribers that they are infringing the rights of others 
and permitting them to rebut the assumptions underlying that warning before technical 
measures are taken against them, these provisions strike the appropriate balance between the 
rights of subscribers and the rights of copyright owners. 
 
237. Determinations made by ISPs when applying the rules made by the Secretary of State 
for the imposition of technical measures are likely to amount to determinations of a civil right 
or obligation within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. The legislation provides for 
appropriate review mechanisms by an independent and impartial tribunal, and these 
mechanisms render the provisions compatible with the Convention. 
 
Power to amend copyright provisions 
238. Clause 17 inserts a new section 302A into the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 
1988 (&#8220;the 1988 Act&#8221;). It enables the Secretary of State to make provision by order to amend 
Part 1 or Part 7 of the 1988 Act for the purpose of preventing or reducing online copyright 
infringement, if it appears to the Secretary of State appropriate to do so having regard to 
technological developments that have occurred or are likely to occur. 
 
239. In addition to the problems caused by services such as unlawful peer-to-peer (P2P) 
file-sharing and other many-to-many infringements which are dealt with by other provisions 
of the Bill, cyber lockers (online data repositories) and similar services have also been 
identified as areas where damaging online copyright infringement are already occurring and 
where the problem could grow rapidly. The government&#8217;s concern is that in a rapidly moving 
technological environment a response that is more flexible than relying on new primary 
legislation is required in order to meet technological evolution. 
 
240. The provisions only contain a power and create no immediate substantive effect. 
Whilst the Convention rights may be engaged by an exercise of the power the government 
believe that the power can be exercised in a manner which is compatible with them. Section 3 
of the Human Rights Act 1998 in any event requires powers to be exercised in a manner that 
is compatible with the Convention rights. Before exercising the power the Secretary of State 
has a duty to consult. A further safeguard is that any order made using the power is subject to 
the affirmative resolution procedure. These safeguards are intended to help ensure that the 
power will only be exercised when necessary and in a proportionate way and only after a fair 
and transparent process has been followed. A further safeguard is that the power specifically 
does not allow the Secretary of State to create or modify any criminal offence. 
 
Topic 3: Power in relation to domain name registries (clauses 18 &#8211; 20) 
241.     These provisions amend the Communications Act 2003 in order to regulate internet 
domain name registries where there has been a serious failure of a registry consisting in either 
the use of prescribed practices that are unfair or involve the misuse of domain names or the 
failure of the registry to have in place a complaints procedure which complies with prescribed 
requirements. The Secretary of State may appoint a manager in respect of the property and 
affairs of the registry to secure that appropriate steps are taken to remedy the failure or the 
consequences of the failure, and/or the Secretary of State may apply to the court to seek an 
order making such alterations to that registry&#8217;s constitution as are necessary to secure that 
appropriate steps are taken to remedy the failure or the consequences of the failure. 
 
242. The measures to be taken by the Secretary of State are only to be taken in 
circumscribed circumstances, to secure specified aims, following adequate opportunity for the 
registry to make representations. The registries will be able to appeal the appointment of a 
manager or a decision of a court. Therefore, although the appointment of a manager and/or 
the alteration of a registry&#8217;s constitution may amount to a interference in the property rights 
relating to a particular registry, the Departments consider that these provisions nonetheless 
represent an appropriate balance between the private rights of registries and their owners to 
conduct their businesses freely and the public interest in ensuring that the entities which 
register internet domain names do not operate in a manner which impacts negatively upon 
consumers, the general public, or the reputation of the UK&#8217;s internet economy. 
 
243. Alteration of the constitution of a registry and the appointment of a manager also 
arguably engage the determination of civil rights and/or obligations pursuant to Article 6 of 
the Convention. However, as regards intervention in respect of a registry&#8217;s constitution, those 
rights are secured by the fact that (a) alteration can only take place after the Secretary of State 
has applied to the court for an order to alter the constitution of a designated registry, and (b) 
the court&#8217;s decision will itself be appealable to a higher court. Furthermore, the alteration the 
court may make is limited to the changes that are necessary for securing that the registry 
rectifies a relevant failure or remedies the consequences of such a failure. With regard to the 
appointment of a manager over the affairs and property of the registry, the Departments 
consider that Article 6 rights are secured by the fact that (a) the powers of the manager are 
limited by the provision that the sole purpose of the appointment is to secure that the registry 
rectifies the relevant failure or to remedy the consequences of the failure, and (b) that the 
decision is appealable on both the facts and the law to Competition Appeal tribunal (and 
thereafter to the Court of Appeal on a point of law). 
Topic 7: Regulation of television and radio services 
Power for the Secretary of State to re-impose conditions under the regulatory regime for 
Channel 3 and Channel 5 licence holders (clause 37) 
244. The Secretary of State currently has the power under section 263 of the 
Communications Act 2003 to provide that conditions which are included as part of the 
regulatory regime for any service should cease to be so included, whether permanently or on a 
temporary basis. Those conditions include, for example, programming quotas, and conditions 
in relation to news and current affairs programming. The power is being extended to provide 
that the Secretary of State has power to re-impose conditions which were previously excluded 
by an order made under section 263. This may adversely affect the rights of licence holders if 
conditions are re-imposed on the licences which they hold. 
 
245. The regulatory regime at Part 3 of the Communications Act 2003 is applicable to 
public service broadcasters. Those broadcasters apply for licences on the basis that they wish 
to be public service broadcasters, and with the expectation that conditions will be placed upon 
their licences to secure compliance with a regime designed to protect the public service nature 
of their broadcasting output. This provision strikes an appropriate balance between the rights 
of broadcasters and the general public interest in securing a robust regulatory regime for 
public service broadcasting. 
 
Topic 8: Access to electromagnetic spectrum 
Power to allow OFCOM to levy penalties for failure to meet licence conditions (clause 39) 
246. OFCOM may impose a penalty on a licence holder who fails to comply with particular 
provisions of a licence which was granted as the result of an auction following a direction 
given by the Secretary of State. The imposition of this penalty will be a determination of civil 
rights under Article 6. However, the procedures involved in determining those civil rights are 
not such as to amount to a breach of Article 6 for the reasons set out below. 
 
247. OFCOM are a statutory body, established under the Communications Act 2003, and 
are required to act in a proportionate and reasonable manner themselves in accordance with 
section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Moreover, an appeal against a decision to levy such 
a penalty will lie to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, an independently constituted body. 
 
248. The levying of a penalty will amount to a deprivation of licence holders&#8217; possessions. 
However, this provision strikes an appropriate balance between the rights of individual 
licence holders and the public interest in the opening up of spectrum to further competition in 
the field of mobile broadband, and ensuring that those who use spectrum are properly 
regulated. Safeguards against the disproportionate exercise of this power include a ceiling on 
the amount of the penalty, the requirement that the amount be appropriate and proportionate 
and the duty of OFCOM to give reasons regarding the imposition of a penalty. 
Topic 9: Provisions in relation to video games classification (clauses 40 and 41 and 
Schedule 1) 
Classification of video games 
249. The authority designated under the Video Recordings Act 1984 (&#8220;the 1984 Act&#8221;) is 
concerned with classifying video works, which includes the provision of age ratings to apply 
to those works and advice on what is contained within the work. The supply of a video work 
other than in accordance with a classification certificate is a criminal offence. The 
amendments to be made to the 1984 Act by the Bill mean that more video games will fall 
within the ambit of the Act. The amendments may affect the economic interests of producers 
and publishers of video games. But the system of regulation and control provided by the 
1984 Act, and the amendments to be made to it by the Bill, represent an acceptable balance 
between the rights of producers and publishers to distribute their work and the legitimate 
interest in the protection of health and morals and the prevention of crime or disorder. In 
particular, one of the purposes of the classification of video games is to protect children from 
the impact of age-inappropriate material. 
 
Appeals from classification decisions 
250. It is proposed that the designated persons who make determinations about the 
classification of video games will be the principal office holders of the Video Standards 
Council (VSC). An appeal from a determination as to whether a video game is suitable for 
classification and if so, the determination of the age rating that applies to it, is arguably a civil 
right for the purposes of Article 6. In designating persons under the 1984 Act, the Secretary of 
State must be satisfied that adequate arrangements will be made for an appeal from 
classification decisions (see section 4(3) of the 1984 Act). The Secretary of State expects to 
require the appeal body that will hear such appeals to be structurally independent of that 
organisation, in that no members of the Video Standards Council would sit on the appeal 
body. In addition any decision of the appeal body may be subject to judicial review. 
 
Offences 
251. The 1984 Act contains a number of offences. For those offences, the primary burden 
of proof rests with the prosecution to establish all the elements of each offence. But the 1984 
Act also provides a number of defences that require the defendant to prove his or her 
knowledge or belief of certain facts or circumstances pertaining at the time of the alleged 
offence. For example, a person does not commit an offence in relation to the supply of a 
video recording if he or she reasonably believed that the supply was exempted. This 
potentially engages Article 6(2). However, such provision is reasonable where the matters are 
matters which will be within the defendant&#8217;s knowledge and which it would be difficult for 
the prosecution to prove, such as matters relating to the defendant&#8217;s state of mind at the time 
of the alleged offence. 
 
Enforcement of classification provisions 
252. Section 17 of the 1984 Act sets out powers of entry, search and seizure. Judicial 
authorisation governs the use of those powers. A justice of the peace must authorise a 
constable to enter and search premises and he can only do so if he is satisfied that there are 
reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence under the Act is being committed, and that 
there is evidence that the offence is or has been committed on those premises. A constable 
may only seize property in these circumstances if he has reasonable grounds to believe that 
that property may be required as evidence in relation to criminal proceedings under the Act. 
The 1984 Act therefore includes safeguards for the use of the powers. The provisions amount 
to an acceptable balance between Article 8 rights, and the public interest in upholding, by 
criminal sanction if appropriate, the classification system. These provisions are not being 
amended by the Bill. 
 
253. Section 21 of the 1984 Act provides for the forfeiture of a video recording where a 
person is convicted of an offence under the Act and a court orders that the goods are to be 
forfeited. Where a criminal offence has been committed and goods that were the subject of 
those proceedings are seized, it is in the public interest to dispose of such property to further 
prevent the commission of offences and the spread of illegal material. The court cannot make 
a forfeiture order unless it gives the owner of the goods (or any person with an interest in the 
goods) an opportunity to be heard or to say why the order should not be made. An order 
cannot be made until after the time to appeal against a conviction has expired and, if an appeal 
has been instituted, that appeal has been determined. This provision represents an acceptable 
balance between the private rights of persons adversely affected by the loss of their 
possessions through forfeiture and the public interest in the proper operation of the 
classification system and the enforcement of that system. Section 21 is not being amended by 
the Bill. 
 
Topic 10: Copyright licensing (clauses 42 and 43 and Schedule 2) 
The granting of licences in relation to orphan works 
254. Section 116A of and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2A to the Copyright Designs and 
Patents Act 1988 (&#8220;the 1988 Act&#8221;) which will be introduced by clause 42 will allow the 
Secretary of State to make regulations for the authorisation of licensing bodies and other 
bodies to license the use of orphan works and orphan rights, as defined in the regulations. The 
compulsory licensing of an orphan work or right is potentially an interference with the rights 
of the unidentified or untraced right holder. 
 
255. This measure strikes an appropriate balance between the private interests of right 
holders in controlling use of their works or rights, and the public interest in allowing the use 
of works or rights where consent cannot be obtained because the right holder cannot be 
identified or traced. Section 116A(6) of and paragraph 1A(6) of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act 
give the Secretary of State power to make regulations determining when a work or rights is 
classified as orphan and when it ceases to be so. The Government intend that such regulations 
will impose adequate checks to ensure that works or rights are not so classified when the right 
holder can be identified and contacted and so is capable of giving consent to their use of their 
work or right. Secondly, the Secretary of State may by regulations made under section 
116A(3) of and paragraph 1A(3) of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act provide for the treatment of 
royalties collected, including holding money for the owner of the orphan work or right should 
they subsequently be identified allowing compensation for use which they have not 
authorised. Finally, the Secretary of State has powers under section 116A(4) of and paragraph 
1A(4) of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act to determine through regulations the rights and 
obligations in respect of an orphan work or right if the owner of rights in the work is 
subsequently identified. It is in the public interest that orphan works and rights should be 
available to the public, subject to safeguards which can be provided by regulations for any 
such owner who is subsequently identified. There is nothing inherent in the powers introduced 
by this clause that could be challenged as a breach of the Convention. Compatibility with the 
Convention will depend on the circumstances and use of the powers. 
 
Extended licensing 
256. Section 116B of and paragraph 1B of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act which are 
introduced by clause 42 provide for the Secretary of State to authorise extended licensing 
schemes. It is doubtful that Article 1 of the First Protocol is engaged in relation to the rights 
of a non-member of a licensing body whose works are licensed by that body under an 
extended licensing scheme because that right holder can opt out of the scheme. The measure 
is compatible with the Convention because it strikes an appropriate balance between the 
interests of the right holder in controlling use of their works, and the public interest in users 
having access to simplified licensing systems for use of copyright works and performers&#8217; 
rights. 
 
The regulation of licensing bodies and bodies that are authorised to use and license the use 
of orphan works or rights 
257. Licensing bodies license the use of copyright or performers&#8217; rights owned by their 
members, collect in royalties and distribute these to members after deducting the expenses of 
collection. The Secretary of State will have powers under section 116C of, Schedule A1 to 
and paragraph 1C of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act (all introduced by clause 41) to make 
regulations requiring licensing bodies to adopt a code of practice if they are authorised to 
license orphan works or rights, or to carry out extended collective licensing or where it 
appears to the Secretary of State that their self-regulation fails to protect the interests of right 
owners, licensees, prospective licensees or members of the public. 
 
258. The Secretary of State also has powers to determine through regulations made under 
section 116A(5) of and paragraph 1A(5) of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act, that a person shall 
cease to be authorised to license the use of orphan works or rights, or a licensing body shall 
cease to be authorised to carry on extended collective licensing where it has failed to comply 
with requirements in those regulations. The Secretary of State has powers under paragraph 
2(2) of Schedule A1 to the 1988 Act to make regulations determining when the regulatory 
requirements cease to apply to a licensing body that is not authorising use of orphan works or 
rights, or carrying on extended collective licensing. There is nothing inherent in the powers 
introduced by these provisions that could be challenged as a breach of Convention. 
Compatibility with the Convention will depend on the circumstances and use of the powers. 
 
259. The imposition of regulatory requirements on a licensing body so that it is not able to 
continue with its licensing activities unless it complies with that regulation may be a 
determination of civil rights and obligations within the meaning of Article 6. Similarly, where 
a licensing body has been authorised to license the use of orphan works or rights, or to carry 
on extended licensing, the removal of that authorisation and the rights attaching to it may be a 
determination of civil rights and obligations. The requirements of Article 6 are met because a 
licensing body will be able to apply for judicial review of any decision to impose regulation 
or to remove authorisation. The same considerations apply to the powers under regulations to 
remove an authorisation from a body other than a licensing body to use or to authorise the use 
or orphan works or rights. That is, such a body will be able to apply for judicial review of any 
decision to remove authorisation. 
 
260. This measure strikes an appropriate balance between the rights of licensing bodies to 
operate freely and the public interest in ensuring that their business practices are transparent 
and take proper account of the interests of licensees and, where relevant, the members they 
represent and the general public. 
 
261. The removal of the right to license the use of orphan works or rights, or to operate an 
extended licensing scheme does not amount to an interference with rights conferred by Article 
1 of the First Protocol. Those rights will be established in detail in regulations, which will set 
out the circumstances under which the rights can be exercised. The jurisprudence of the 
European Court of Human Rights has made clear that, where a right is granted, removal of the 
right does not amount to a deprivation of that right if it is exercised in a manner which is 
inconsistent with conditions which made the exercise of that right possible. 
 
Imposition of penalties 
262. Paragraph 3 of Schedule A1 to the 1988 Act will allow the Secretary of State to make 
regulations to impose penalties, including financial penalties, on a licensing body if it fails to 
comply with a Code of Practice imposed under the Schedule. Any such penalty may amount 
to a determination of civil rights or a criminal charge under Article 6 of the Convention. The 
nature of the penalty will be determined by the regulations made by the Secretary of State in 
exercise of the power taken. At that time, it will be necessary to consider whether the extra 
protections in Article 6(2) and 6(3) of the Convention apply, and how they are met when the 
Regulations are made. These Regulations may provide for a right of appeal to the Copyright 
Tribunal against the imposition of a penalty; an appeal to such an independent and impartial 
tribunal will be compliant with Article 6. There is nothing inherent in the powers introduced 
by this clause that could be challenged as a breach of the Convention. Compatibility with the 
Convention will depend on the circumstances and use of the powers. 
 
Topic 11: Provisions in relation to Public Lending Right (clause 44) 
263. This measure amends the Secretary of State&#8217;s power under the Public Lending Right 
Act 1979 to make a scheme determining eligibility of authors for public lending right 
payments. The amendment will mean that the scheme can include audio-books and e-books, 
and their authors, producers and narrators. Interference with copyright holders&#8217; rights, and 
rights in performances, will potentially occur, because the owners of those rights in relation to 
works newly included in the scheme will no longer be able to prohibit or licence the lending 
of such works by public libraries. Article 1 of the First Protocol will not be engaged until any 
amendments to the scheme are made under the expanded power. 
 
264. The government considers that when the amendments are made, there will be no 
breach of Article 1 of the First Protocol because the power strikes an appropriate balance 
between the private interests of intellectual property owners, and the public interest in 
permitting the extension of the works covered by the scheme at a time when there is an 
increasing demand for the lending of books in formats other than printed and bound formats 
(audio-books, for example). Furthermore, the scheme provides that some of the copyright and 
performance rights owners will be compensated for the loss of the power to contract 
individually with public libraries, as they will receive remuneration on a &#8220;rate per loan&#8221; basis. 
 
COMMENCEMENT 
 
265. Clause 48 provides that most provisions of the Act will come into force at the end of 
two months after the Act is passed. 
 
266.   The following clauses come into force on the day which the Act is passed:
