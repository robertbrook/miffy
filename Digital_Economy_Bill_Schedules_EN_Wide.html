                      <p>
                        188. Section 4 of the 1984 Act makes provision about the arrangements to be made by the designated authority. Sections 4(1)(b)(i) and (ii) and 7 are to be amended to clarify that the arrangements may include provision for the revocation of classification certificates.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        189. A new subsection (1C) is to be inserted into section 4 so that arrangements made under this section may require a person seeking a classification certificate for a video work to agree to comply with a code of practice, such as the PEGI11 code of practice. That code includes provision relating to the labelling of video recordings.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        190. A new subsection (3A) is to be inserted into section 4 to ensure that, prior to making any designation under section 4, the Secretary of State must satisfy himself that adequate arrangements will be made for taking account of public opinion in the United Kingdom. This means that the designated authority must have an effective system to gauge public opinion and take account of it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        191. Section 4(5) currently requires the Secretary of State to approve tariffs for fees to be charged by the designated authority in connection with the classification of video works. The Bill would amend this so that the designated authority simply has to consult the Secretary of State about the fees that it proposes to charge.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        192. A new subsection (6A) is to be inserted into section 4 to ensure that the designated authority complies with any guidance issued by the Secretary of State relating to arrangements made under that section. For example, the Secretary of State may provide guidance on administrative matters such as how records of classification certificates are to be kept and how appeal arrangements may be set up. New subsection (6B) makes it clear that the Secretary of State’s guidance is not to extend to the criteria to be taken into account in making individual classification decisions. Section 4A of the 1984 Act sets out the criteria to which special regard is to be given by the designated authority when making such decisions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        193. New section 7A of the 1984 Act provides that classification certificates may be issued so as to have effect only for the purposes of a particular video recording. This enables video works to be classified by reference to the recording in which they are to be published. For example, a video game may be classified for the purposes only of its supply for use on a particular platform, such as Nintendo or Xbox. Section 7A(2) provides that, in such a case, the classification certificate can only be relied on for the supply of the video work for use on that platform and not for its supply more generally.
                      </p>

                        http://www.videostandards.org.uk 194. The offences set out in the 1984 Act at sections 11 (supplying a video recording of classified work in breach of classification), 13 (supplying a video recording not complying with requirements as to labels, etc) and 14 (supplying a video recording containing false information as to classification) are amended to provide that an offence is not committed where the video work concerned is an exempted work or the defendant believed on reasonable grounds that the video work was an exempted work. For example, the defendant might believe, on reasonable grounds, that a video game has not been classified because it is suitable for viewing by persons aged under 12, having regard to the criteria set out in new section 2A(2)(a) to (h).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        195. The offences under the 1984 Act relate to the supply, or possession for the purpose of supply, of a video recording that contains a video work. Section 22(2) of the 1984 Act provides that a video recording contains a video work if it contains information by means of which all or part of the video work can be produced. There is an exception to this: if a video work contains an extract of another video work (for example, a film that includes an extract from another film), the extract is not part of the work of which it is an extract but a part of the video work which contains the extract; and hence the video recording contains that video work including the extract. An increasing variety of video recordings are available, some of which contain a mixture of films and video games. New subsection (2A) of section 22 would provide a power for the Secretary of State to make provision about the circumstances in which a video recording does or does not contain a video work for the purposes of the 1984 Act. This would allow provision to be made to take account of new formats, such as where a video game contains a whole film within it or a film contains a game within it.

                        Clause Topic 10: Copyright and performers’ property rights: licensing and penalties Clause 42: Extension and regulation of licensing of copyright and performers’ rights
                      </span>
                      <p>
                        196. This clause introduces powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations authorising the use of orphan works (defined in regulations) and extended licensing as well as the regulation of licensing bodies. Currently, some uses of a work without the consent of the copyright owner even where that owner cannot be identified or traced are an infringement of copyright. There are civil penalties for infringement and infringement can be a criminal offence if it takes place on a commercial basis. As a result, many orphan works, some of significant cultural value, are not used.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        197. The advent of digital media has increased the volume and speed at which material protected by copyright or performers’ rights is created and disseminated in the United Kingdom. Extended licensing will allow a licensing body to act on behalf of those remaining rights holders who are not members of, and so are not represented by, the body once that body has been authorised to do so by the Secretary of State. This is intended to make the system of rights clearance simpler for those seeking to use works.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        198. Any licensing body authorised to operate extended licensing, or to license orphan works, or that is failing to self-regulate, will be subject to obligations to adopt a code of practice. 199. The clause introduces four new sections into the Copyright, Designs and Patent Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”):

                        <li>
                          Section 116A enables the Secretary of State to make regulations which will provide for the authorisation of a licensing body or other person to use or to license the use of orphan works. It also provides for regulations to define orphan works. Subsections (2) to (5) of the section enable the Secretary of State to determine whether a licensing body or other person meets the requirements for authorisation, and to provide for the treatment of royalties and other sums paid for authorisation of the use of orphan works and for the rights and obligations of any person if a works ceases to be an orphan work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Section 116B enables the Secretary of State to make regulations to authorise a licensing body to operate extended licensing of published works and to allow a rights owner to exclude itself from such licensing by notice. Subsections (2) to (5) of section 116A apply also to regulations about extended licensing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Section 116C introduces Schedule A1 to the 1988 Act (inserted by subsection (2) of the clause and Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Bill) which confers powers on the Secretary of State to provide for codes of practice relating to licensing bodies and the regulation of licensing bodies and other bodies authorised under sections 116A and 116B.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Section 116D provides that section 116B and Schedule A1 do not apply in relation to Crown copyright or Parliamentary copyright. It also makes general provision about regulations under the provisions inserted by the clause, including provision about parliamentary procedure for making regulations.
                        </li>

                        200. The Gowers Review of intellectual property12 recommended that the penalties for online copyright infringement under section 107 of the 1988 Act should be matched with those that apply for physical infringement, by increasing the maximum prison sentence. Section 107 of the 1988 Act currently restricts fines awarded on summary conviction for criminal infringement of copyright under section 107(4)(a) and 107(4A)(a) to the statutory maximum, which is £5,000 in England and Wales and £10,000 in Scotland. The clause increases the maximum fine that may be imposed for these offences to £50,000. It also increases the maximum fine on summary conviction for making, importing, distributing or

                        Schedule 2: Licensing of copyright and performers’ property rights
                      </span>
                      <p>
                        201. The Schedule makes supplementary amendments to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”) in connection with clause 42.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        202. Part 1 of Schedule 2 inserts Schedule A1 into the 1988 Act. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Part 1 give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations requiring a licensing body to comply with a code of practice which complies with requirements set out in those regulations and to impose a code on any licensing body that fails to do so. Paragraph 2 provides that these powers can only be exercised for the purposes of provision made under section 116A, that is the authorisation of the use of orphan works or section 116B, that is the authorisation of extended licensing or where it appears to the Secretary of State that a licensing body’s system of self-regulation is failing. Paragraph 2 also enables provision to be made for the procedures to be followed before regulation is applied or ceases to apply.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        203. Paragraph 3 enables the Secretary of State to make regulations to provide for the consequences of the non-compliance with a code of practice or authorisation under section 116A or 116B, including financial penalties and a right of appeal to the Copyright Tribunal.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        204.   Paragraph 4 makes provision for fees to be charged to licensing bodies for regulation.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        205. Part 2 of Schedule 2 inserts paragraphs 1A to 1D into Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act. These paragraphs contain provisions equivalent to sections 116A to 116D for performers’ property rights and apply Schedule A1 in relation to those rights.

                      <p>
                        Topic 11: Public Lending Right Background 206. Clause 44 amends the Public Lending Right Act 1979 (“the 1979 Act”) and the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”) to reflect the changing nature of book publishing and the increasing demand for the loan of books from public libraries in formats other than print. It does this by:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Extending eligibility for public lending right (“PLR”) payments to the authors of audio-books and e-books;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Extending PLR to producers and narrators of books that are recorded as sound recordings; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Protecting public libraries who lend the books from liability for breach of copyright or breach of rights in performances. 207. The clause does not extend PLR to works that are available for loan from public libraries but that do not consist mainly of written or spoken words or still pictures. For example, films, music recordings and computer games are not covered. Neither does the clause extend PLR to digital files downloaded outside library premises.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        208. Since its introduction in 1979, PLR has compensated authors for the potential loss in sales resulting from their works being freely available to borrow from public libraries. Under the current PLR scheme established by virtue of the 1979 Act translators, editors, compilers and illustrators are included (along with writers) in the definition of ‘author’ and so are eligible for PLR payments. PLR is now recognised by European legislation (Directive 2006/115/EC on rental right and lending right) as reflecting and protecting the exclusive lending and rental rights of holders of rights in print books.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        209. Authors, performers and producers of non-print books, such as audio-books and e- books, have rights conferred on them under the 1988 Act allowing them (or anyone to whom they have assigned their rights) to authorise or prohibit the lending of their work by public libraries. The law currently requires libraries to enter into individual contractual and financial arrangements with those rights holders for the lending of non-print books.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        210. It is the view of government that this requirement could be having an impact on the willingness of libraries to lend audio and e-books. It could also be resulting in libraries lending works in breach of the rights of authors and other rights holders. Clause 44 is designed to help simplify the current system of payment to rights holders, give a wider range of rights holders’ protection under the PLR scheme, and support innovation in publishing and the creative industries. The government hopes that it will also increase non-print lending by encouraging authors to enter the non-print market.

                        Clause 44: Public lending right
                      </span>
                      <p>
                        211. This clause amends the definition of “book” in the Public Lending Right Act 1979. The 1979 Act pre-dated the advent of most audio and e-books and consequently use of the word “books” within it is interpreted as being limited to books in printed format. This clause extends the definition to works that are recorded as sound recordings, and works recorded electronically, so long as they consist mainly of written or spoken words or still pictures. As is already the case for printed books, it is intended that the PLR payment scheme established under the 1979 Act will not cover audio and e-books whose author is described as other than a natural person, or that are musical scores, Crown Copyright publications, newspapers, journals or periodicals, or that are not offered for sale to the public or do not have an international standard book number (“ISBN”).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        212. The clause also amends the definitions of “lending”, “loan” and “borrowed” in the 1979 Act with the aim of capturing almost all cases in which a public library makes a book (whether in print or audio or e-book form) available to a member of the public for use away from the library for a limited period of time. The exception is where the book is communicated by means of electronic transmission to a place other than the library, for example where the library makes digital files available for remote downloading. In practice this exception is likely to apply to e-books for which a licensing agreement exists between the library and author or publisher under which incremental payment is made based on usage, rather than on individual units purchased on a once-and-for-all basis.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        213. The clause amends the definition of “author” in the 1979 Act. Producers and narrators of audio-books and of e-books recorded as sound recordings play a role in making works in audio formats new and unique creations, not just different formats of the same printed volume. Like authors, producers and narrators are conferred with lending rights under the 1988 Act: copyright in the case of producers and performers’ rights in the case of narrators. This clause extends eligibility for PLR to those additional categories of rights holder.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        214. PLR as extended by the clause continues to be available to all rights holders primarily resident within the European Economic Area (EEA). The clause also preserves the lending rights of non-EEA rights holders under the 1988 Act so that they remain able to license or assign their rights to public libraries (and other persons) independently.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        215. The clause makes consequential amendments of the 1988 Act to reflect the extended definitions of “book”, “author” and “lending” in the 1979 Act. The amendments reduce the scope of copyright and rights in performances under the 1988 Act. This is to protect public libraries from liability under that Act when they lend works that are eligible for PLR. As a result of the changes, libraries will generally no longer need to make agreements with authors before lending out their e-books and audio-books.

                        216. This clause gives the Secretary of State the power to make incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitional, transitory or saving provision in connection with the amendments to various enactments made by the Bill. Certain necessary consequential amendments have already been identified and are included in the Bill. This power allows any further amendments to be made, where necessary, in order to give proper effect to the provisions made by the Bill.

Subsection (2) provides that any amendments made by this Bill to the Acts listed in subsection (2) may be extended to any of the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man under relevant extending powers in those Acts. Subsection (4) permits amendments made by this Bill to Part 1 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to be extended to any British overseas territory under section 157(2) of that Act.

                        220. The Public Lending Right Registrar distributes DCMS grant in aid (“GiA”) to authors as PLR payments. Expanding PLR to cover books in non-print formats will require an ongoing commitment to provide additional GiA of an estimated £0.75 million per year.

                      <p>
                        221. The Bill also includes a number of provisions which make changes to OFCOM's activities and duties. It is expected that the additional duties the Bill places on OFCOM, and any associated increase in staffing, can be carried out within OFCOM's existing expenditure cap. The new local and regional news activity (clause 28) will be financed through a new source of funding additional to the existing funding cap. Further information about long-term funding can be found in The Government’s response to the consultation on “Sustainable independent and impartial news in the Nations, locally and in the regions” 13.

                        222.       A package of impact assessments has been published. This includes:

                        http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/publications/6431.aspx 224. The Bill brings forward a number of specific policy proposals, decisions and recommendations across several substantive policy areas. The rationale for these different proposals, and the respective costs and benefits of these measures, are summarised in the overarching impact assessment, and discussed in detail in the individual impact assessments. There is not an aggregated cost/benefit analysis.

                      <p>
                        225.   Key monetised and non-monetised costs include:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Potential costs to consumers and businesses if the changes to OFCOM’s general duties were to result in reduced clarity about OFCOM’s remit;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Costs of implementation of the online copyright infringement provisions, estimated to be in the region of £290 to £500 million, with the possibility of higher costs to broadband consumers;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Potential compliance costs to members of internet domain registries should they have to comply with a request from the Secretary of State;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          One-off costs for the implementation of the news provisions. These will need to be determined;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          A small loss to producers of Gaelic programming; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Due to the extension of the radio licence renewal regime, a loss to Government of around £10 million where it might have raised funds via the “blind auction”. The regime will also reduce opportunities to enter the analogue commercial industry, therefore potentially reducing competition.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        226.   Key monetised and non-monetised benefits are likely to arise as follows:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Changes to OFCOM’s general duties are likely to improve OFCOM’s ability to further citizens’ and consumers’ interests through promoting greater and accelerated investment by network operators and in UK public service content;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The online copyright infringement provisions will bring benefits to rights-holders by recovering displaced sales (estimated benefit £1700 million);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The provisions on internet domain names are expected to benefit consumers by giving greater protection in terms of reduced exposure to risk of financial loss and less distress associated with mistakenly accessing a (fake) site similar to the one they were intending to access, and the availability of better delineated disputes procedure; • By allowing flexibility around licence obligations, the provisions on public service broadcasting should ensure that the costs of licences reflect their true market value. This should allow licence holders to make cost savings based on short term variations to public service obligations;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Co-location changes introduced by the provisions on independent radio services are expected to allow cost savings and economies of scale. Large stations could see profits before interest and tax rise from six per cent to 24 per cent assuming a ten per cent fall in advertising revenue or from six per cent to seven per cent assuming a 20 per cent fall in revenue;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Provisions on extended collective licensing are not themselves expected to bring monetised benefits. However, anecdotal evidence suggests an estimated reduction in administration costs of two to five per cent. Provisions on matched penalties may bring indirect benefits to business through a reduction in pirated goods and an increase in legal sales of their products;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Provisions on public lending right could bring benefits to rights holders in non-print books of up to £750,000 in additional payments.
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>

                        COMPATIBILITY WITH THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        228. Section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the Minister in charge of a Bill in either House of Parliament to make a statement about the compatibility of the provisions of the Bill with the Convention rights (as defined by section 1 of that Act).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        229.   Lord Mandelson has made the following statement:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “In my view the provisions of the Digital Economy Bill [HL] are compatible with the Convention rights.”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        230. All of the provisions of the Bill have been considered in relation to compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights and other international human rights obligations. Only those clauses which raise potential compatibility issues are discussed below. In relation to the remainder of the clauses, there are no rights potentially engaged. Topic 1: General duties of OFCOM Power for OFCOM to require information from network providers (clause 2) 231. Article 8 of the Convention is potentially engaged but that would depend on the circumstances and use of the power. It is possible that some of the information which will be required to be provided may constitute commercially confidential information. Such information supplied by network providers is capable of being information which would engage Article 8.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        232. However, OFCOM are a public authority for the purposes of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and must therefore exercise any power compatibly with Convention rights. In addition, section 137 of the Communications Act 2003 provides that any request for information must be proportionate to the use to which the information is to be put. The information to be provided by network providers is necessary to enable OFCOM to fulfil their new reporting duties under this clause in relation to the capability and resilience of the communications infrastructure and internet domain names. Section 393 of the Communications Act 2003 places restrictions on the disclosure of information obtained under powers conferred by that Act. It is therefore considered that conferring this power on OFCOM does not constitute a breach of Article 8 rights.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Topic 2: Online infringement of copyright (clauses 4-17) Notification provisions 233. Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention are potentially engaged by these measures. The Bill will place requirements on internet service providers (“ISPs”) to comply with two initial obligations; to send notifications to subscribers who have been identified by copyright owners in relation to alleged infringements of copyright; and to maintain internal lists of the number of times an individual subscriber has been identified and provide certain (non-identifying) information from those lists to affected copyright owners on request.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Additional technical measures 234. The Secretary of State will have the power by order to impose obligations on ISPs to take technical measures against internet subscribers. Such measures may include temporary suspension, bandwidth capping and bandwidth shaping. OFCOM will adopt a code of practice setting out procedures to enable ISPs to give effect to these measures.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        235. When following any rules specified by the Secretary of State or OFCOM for giving effect to the technical measures, ISPs will potentially be hindering subscribers from accessing the internet (and hence their e-correspondence), or from having the broadband connection speed and content they contracted for. These measures may amount to interferences with the right to respect for private life, the right to freedom of expression and the right to peaceful possession of property. The rights are engaged because affecting the ability of a subscriber to access the internet at a given speed or, potentially, at all will tend to affect their ability to communicate with others by on-line methods (by email, and through instant messaging and contributions to internet discussions). This would tend to affect their private and family life in the widest sense, but also Article 10 rights to freedom of expression and freedom of information.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        236. However, such interference does not render the provisions incompatible with the Convention. The provision represents an acceptable balance between subscribers’ rights and the public interest in the protection of the copyright of third parties. Copyright owners have limited methods of protecting their copyright, which may be less effective across national boundaries than within a single jurisdiction. Infringement over the internet is likely to cross national boundaries. Moreover, subscribers may be infringing the rights of more than one copyright owner at a time, and these provisions permit action benefiting many copyright owner. By providing for a warning to subscribers that they are infringing the rights of others and permitting them to rebut the assumptions underlying that warning before technical measures are taken against them, these provisions strike the appropriate balance between the rights of subscribers and the rights of copyright owners.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        237. Determinations made by ISPs when applying the rules made by the Secretary of State for the imposition of technical measures are likely to amount to determinations of a civil right or obligation within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. The legislation provides for appropriate review mechanisms by an independent and impartial tribunal, and these mechanisms render the provisions compatible with the Convention.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Power to amend copyright provisions 238. Clause 17 inserts a new section 302A into the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”). It enables the Secretary of State to make provision by order to amend Part 1 or Part 7 of the 1988 Act for the purpose of preventing or reducing online copyright infringement, if it appears to the Secretary of State appropriate to do so having regard to technological developments that have occurred or are likely to occur.
                      </p>

                        239. In addition to the problems caused by services such as unlawful peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing and other many-to-many infringements which are dealt with by other provisions of the Bill, cyber lockers (online data repositories) and similar services have also been identified as areas where damaging online copyright infringement are already occurring and where the problem could grow rapidly. The government’s concern is that in a rapidly moving technological environment a response that is more flexible than relying on new primary legislation is required in order to meet technological evolution.

                      <p>
                        240. The provisions only contain a power and create no immediate substantive effect. Whilst the Convention rights may be engaged by an exercise of the power the government believe that the power can be exercised in a manner which is compatible with them. Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 in any event requires powers to be exercised in a manner that is compatible with the Convention rights. Before exercising the power the Secretary of State has a duty to consult. A further safeguard is that any order made using the power is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. These safeguards are intended to help ensure that the power will only be exercised when necessary and in a proportionate way and only after a fair and transparent process has been followed. A further safeguard is that the power specifically does not allow the Secretary of State to create or modify any criminal offence.

                      <p>
                        Topic 3: Power in relation to domain name registries (clauses 18 – 20) 241.     These provisions amend the Communications Act 2003 in order to regulate internet domain name registries where there has been a serious failure of a registry consisting in either the use of prescribed practices that are unfair or involve the misuse of domain names or the failure of the registry to have in place a complaints procedure which complies with prescribed requirements. The Secretary of State may appoint a manager in respect of the property and affairs of the registry to secure that appropriate steps are taken to remedy the failure or the consequences of the failure, and/or the Secretary of State may apply to the court to seek an order making such alterations to that registry’s constitution as are necessary to secure that appropriate steps are taken to remedy the failure or the consequences of the failure.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        242. The measures to be taken by the Secretary of State are only to be taken in circumscribed circumstances, to secure specified aims, following adequate opportunity for the registry to make representations. The registries will be able to appeal the appointment of a manager or a decision of a court. Therefore, although the appointment of a manager and/or the alteration of a registry’s constitution may amount to a interference in the property rights relating to a particular registry, the Departments consider that these provisions nonetheless represent an appropriate balance between the private rights of registries and their owners to conduct their businesses freely and the public interest in ensuring that the entities which register internet domain names do not operate in a manner which impacts negatively upon consumers, the general public, or the reputation of the UK’s internet economy.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        243. Alteration of the constitution of a registry and the appointment of a manager also arguably engage the determination of civil rights and/or obligations pursuant to Article 6 of the Convention. However, as regards intervention in respect of a registry’s constitution, those rights are secured by the fact that (a) alteration can only take place after the Secretary of State has applied to the court for an order to alter the constitution of a designated registry, and (b) the court’s decision will itself be appealable to a higher court. Furthermore, the alteration the court may make is limited to the changes that are necessary for securing that the registry rectifies a relevant failure or remedies the consequences of such a failure. With regard to the appointment of a manager over the affairs and property of the registry, the Departments consider that Article 6 rights are secured by the fact that (a) the powers of the manager are limited by the provision that the sole purpose of the appointment is to secure that the registry rectifies the relevant failure or to remedy the consequences of the failure, and (b) that the decision is appealable on both the facts and the law to Competition Appeal tribunal (and thereafter to the Court of Appeal on a point of law). Topic 7: Regulation of television and radio services Power for the Secretary of State to re-impose conditions under the regulatory regime for Channel 3 and Channel 5 licence holders (clause 37) 244. The Secretary of State currently has the power under section 263 of the Communications Act 2003 to provide that conditions which are included as part of the regulatory regime for any service should cease to be so included, whether permanently or on a temporary basis. Those conditions include, for example, programming quotas, and conditions in relation to news and current affairs programming. The power is being extended to provide that the Secretary of State has power to re-impose conditions which were previously excluded by an order made under section 263. This may adversely affect the rights of licence holders if conditions are re-imposed on the licences which they hold.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        245. The regulatory regime at Part 3 of the Communications Act 2003 is applicable to public service broadcasters. Those broadcasters apply for licences on the basis that they wish to be public service broadcasters, and with the expectation that conditions will be placed upon their licences to secure compliance with a regime designed to protect the public service nature of their broadcasting output. This provision strikes an appropriate balance between the rights of broadcasters and the general public interest in securing a robust regulatory regime for public service broadcasting.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Topic 8: Access to electromagnetic spectrum Power to allow OFCOM to levy penalties for failure to meet licence conditions (clause 39) 246. OFCOM may impose a penalty on a licence holder who fails to comply with particular provisions of a licence which was granted as the result of an auction following a direction given by the Secretary of State. The imposition of this penalty will be a determination of civil rights under Article 6. However, the procedures involved in determining those civil rights are not such as to amount to a breach of Article 6 for the reasons set out below.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        247. OFCOM are a statutory body, established under the Communications Act 2003, and are required to act in a proportionate and reasonable manner themselves in accordance with section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Moreover, an appeal against a decision to levy such a penalty will lie to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, an independently constituted body.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        248. The levying of a penalty will amount to a deprivation of licence holders’ possessions. However, this provision strikes an appropriate balance between the rights of individual licence holders and the public interest in the opening up of spectrum to further competition in the field of mobile broadband, and ensuring that those who use spectrum are properly regulated. Safeguards against the disproportionate exercise of this power include a ceiling on the amount of the penalty, the requirement that the amount be appropriate and proportionate and the duty of OFCOM to give reasons regarding the imposition of a penalty. Topic 9: Provisions in relation to video games classification (clauses 40 and 41 and Schedule 1) Classification of video games 249. The authority designated under the Video Recordings Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act”) is concerned with classifying video works, which includes the provision of age ratings to apply to those works and advice on what is contained within the work. The supply of a video work other than in accordance with a classification certificate is a criminal offence. The amendments to be made to the 1984 Act by the Bill mean that more video games will fall within the ambit of the Act. The amendments may affect the economic interests of producers and publishers of video games. But the system of regulation and control provided by the 1984 Act, and the amendments to be made to it by the Bill, represent an acceptable balance between the rights of producers and publishers to distribute their work and the legitimate interest in the protection of health and morals and the prevention of crime or disorder. In particular, one of the purposes of the classification of video games is to protect children from the impact of age-inappropriate material.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Appeals from classification decisions 250. It is proposed that the designated persons who make determinations about the classification of video games will be the principal office holders of the Video Standards Council (VSC). An appeal from a determination as to whether a video game is suitable for classification and if so, the determination of the age rating that applies to it, is arguably a civil right for the purposes of Article 6. In designating persons under the 1984 Act, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that adequate arrangements will be made for an appeal from classification decisions (see section 4(3) of the 1984 Act). The Secretary of State expects to require the appeal body that will hear such appeals to be structurally independent of that organisation, in that no members of the Video Standards Council would sit on the appeal body. In addition any decision of the appeal body may be subject to judicial review.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Offences 251. The 1984 Act contains a number of offences. For those offences, the primary burden of proof rests with the prosecution to establish all the elements of each offence. But the 1984 Act also provides a number of defences that require the defendant to prove his or her knowledge or belief of certain facts or circumstances pertaining at the time of the alleged offence. For example, a person does not commit an offence in relation to the supply of a video recording if he or she reasonably believed that the supply was exempted. This potentially engages Article 6(2). However, such provision is reasonable where the matters are matters which will be within the defendant’s knowledge and which it would be difficult for the prosecution to prove, such as matters relating to the defendant’s state of mind at the time of the alleged offence.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Enforcement of classification provisions 252. Section 17 of the 1984 Act sets out powers of entry, search and seizure. Judicial authorisation governs the use of those powers. A justice of the peace must authorise a constable to enter and search premises and he can only do so if he is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence under the Act is being committed, and that there is evidence that the offence is or has been committed on those premises. A constable may only seize property in these circumstances if he has reasonable grounds to believe that that property may be required as evidence in relation to criminal proceedings under the Act. The 1984 Act therefore includes safeguards for the use of the powers. The provisions amount to an acceptable balance between Article 8 rights, and the public interest in upholding, by criminal sanction if appropriate, the classification system. These provisions are not being amended by the Bill.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        253. Section 21 of the 1984 Act provides for the forfeiture of a video recording where a person is convicted of an offence under the Act and a court orders that the goods are to be forfeited. Where a criminal offence has been committed and goods that were the subject of those proceedings are seized, it is in the public interest to dispose of such property to further prevent the commission of offences and the spread of illegal material. The court cannot make a forfeiture order unless it gives the owner of the goods (or any person with an interest in the goods) an opportunity to be heard or to say why the order should not be made. An order cannot be made until after the time to appeal against a conviction has expired and, if an appeal has been instituted, that appeal has been determined. This provision represents an acceptable balance between the private rights of persons adversely affected by the loss of their possessions through forfeiture and the public interest in the proper operation of the classification system and the enforcement of that system. Section 21 is not being amended by the Bill.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Topic 10: Copyright licensing (clauses 42 and 43 and Schedule 2) The granting of licences in relation to orphan works 254. Section 116A of and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2A to the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”) which will be introduced by clause 42 will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations for the authorisation of licensing bodies and other bodies to license the use of orphan works and orphan rights, as defined in the regulations. The compulsory licensing of an orphan work or right is potentially an interference with the rights of the unidentified or untraced right holder.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        255. This measure strikes an appropriate balance between the private interests of right holders in controlling use of their works or rights, and the public interest in allowing the use of works or rights where consent cannot be obtained because the right holder cannot be identified or traced. Section 116A(6) of and paragraph 1A(6) of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act give the Secretary of State power to make regulations determining when a work or rights is classified as orphan and when it ceases to be so. The Government intend that such regulations will impose adequate checks to ensure that works or rights are not so classified when the right holder can be identified and contacted and so is capable of giving consent to their use of their work or right. Secondly, the Secretary of State may by regulations made under section 116A(3) of and paragraph 1A(3) of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act provide for the treatment of royalties collected, including holding money for the owner of the orphan work or right should they subsequently be identified allowing compensation for use which they have not authorised. Finally, the Secretary of State has powers under section 116A(4) of and paragraph 1A(4) of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act to determine through regulations the rights and obligations in respect of an orphan work or right if the owner of rights in the work is subsequently identified. It is in the public interest that orphan works and rights should be available to the public, subject to safeguards which can be provided by regulations for any such owner who is subsequently identified. There is nothing inherent in the powers introduced by this clause that could be challenged as a breach of the Convention. Compatibility with the Convention will depend on the circumstances and use of the powers.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Extended licensing 256. Section 116B of and paragraph 1B of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act which are introduced by clause 42 provide for the Secretary of State to authorise extended licensing schemes. It is doubtful that Article 1 of the First Protocol is engaged in relation to the rights of a non-member of a licensing body whose works are licensed by that body under an extended licensing scheme because that right holder can opt out of the scheme. The measure is compatible with the Convention because it strikes an appropriate balance between the interests of the right holder in controlling use of their works, and the public interest in users having access to simplified licensing systems for use of copyright works and performers’ rights.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The regulation of licensing bodies and bodies that are authorised to use and license the use of orphan works or rights 257. Licensing bodies license the use of copyright or performers’ rights owned by their members, collect in royalties and distribute these to members after deducting the expenses of collection. The Secretary of State will have powers under section 116C of, Schedule A1 to and paragraph 1C of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act (all introduced by clause 41) to make regulations requiring licensing bodies to adopt a code of practice if they are authorised to license orphan works or rights, or to carry out extended collective licensing or where it appears to the Secretary of State that their self-regulation fails to protect the interests of right owners, licensees, prospective licensees or members of the public.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        258. The Secretary of State also has powers to determine through regulations made under section 116A(5) of and paragraph 1A(5) of Schedule 2A to the 1988 Act, that a person shall cease to be authorised to license the use of orphan works or rights, or a licensing body shall cease to be authorised to carry on extended collective licensing where it has failed to comply with requirements in those regulations. The Secretary of State has powers under paragraph 2(2) of Schedule A1 to the 1988 Act to make regulations determining when the regulatory requirements cease to apply to a licensing body that is not authorising use of orphan works or rights, or carrying on extended collective licensing. There is nothing inherent in the powers introduced by these provisions that could be challenged as a breach of Convention. Compatibility with the Convention will depend on the circumstances and use of the powers.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        259. The imposition of regulatory requirements on a licensing body so that it is not able to continue with its licensing activities unless it complies with that regulation may be a determination of civil rights and obligations within the meaning of Article 6. Similarly, where a licensing body has been authorised to license the use of orphan works or rights, or to carry on extended licensing, the removal of that authorisation and the rights attaching to it may be a determination of civil rights and obligations. The requirements of Article 6 are met because a licensing body will be able to apply for judicial review of any decision to impose regulation or to remove authorisation. The same considerations apply to the powers under regulations to remove an authorisation from a body other than a licensing body to use or to authorise the use or orphan works or rights. That is, such a body will be able to apply for judicial review of any decision to remove authorisation.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        260. This measure strikes an appropriate balance between the rights of licensing bodies to operate freely and the public interest in ensuring that their business practices are transparent and take proper account of the interests of licensees and, where relevant, the members they represent and the general public.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        261. The removal of the right to license the use of orphan works or rights, or to operate an extended licensing scheme does not amount to an interference with rights conferred by Article 1 of the First Protocol. Those rights will be established in detail in regulations, which will set out the circumstances under which the rights can be exercised. The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights has made clear that, where a right is granted, removal of the right does not amount to a deprivation of that right if it is exercised in a manner which is inconsistent with conditions which made the exercise of that right possible.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Imposition of penalties 262. Paragraph 3 of Schedule A1 to the 1988 Act will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to impose penalties, including financial penalties, on a licensing body if it fails to comply with a Code of Practice imposed under the Schedule. Any such penalty may amount to a determination of civil rights or a criminal charge under Article 6 of the Convention. The nature of the penalty will be determined by the regulations made by the Secretary of State in exercise of the power taken. At that time, it will be necessary to consider whether the extra protections in Article 6(2) and 6(3) of the Convention apply, and how they are met when the Regulations are made. These Regulations may provide for a right of appeal to the Copyright Tribunal against the imposition of a penalty; an appeal to such an independent and impartial tribunal will be compliant with Article 6. There is nothing inherent in the powers introduced by this clause that could be challenged as a breach of the Convention. Compatibility with the Convention will depend on the circumstances and use of the powers.

                        Topic 11: Provisions in relation to Public Lending Right (clause 44) 263. This measure amends the Secretary of State’s power under the Public Lending Right Act 1979 to make a scheme determining eligibility of authors for public lending right payments. The amendment will mean that the scheme can include audio-books and e-books, and their authors, producers and narrators. Interference with copyright holders’ rights, and rights in performances, will potentially occur, because the owners of those rights in relation to works newly included in the scheme will no longer be able to prohibit or licence the lending of such works by public libraries. Article 1 of the First Protocol will not be engaged until any amendments to the scheme are made under the expanded power.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        264. The government considers that when the amendments are made, there will be no breach of Article 1 of the First Protocol because the power strikes an appropriate balance between the private interests of intellectual property owners, and the public interest in permitting the extension of the works covered by the scheme at a time when there is an increasing demand for the lending of books in formats other than printed and bound formats (audio-books, for example). Furthermore, the scheme provides that some of the copyright and performance rights owners will be compensated for the loss of the power to contract individually with public libraries, as they will receive remuneration on a “rate per loan” basis.
